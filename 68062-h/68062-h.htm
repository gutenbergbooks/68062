<h2 class="nobreak" id="TPTW">THE PLAY THAT WON</h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">When the knock came Ted was slumped on
his spine in the Morris chair, the green-shaded
lamp beside him and a magazine
propped on his chest. It was Saturday night and
study was not imperative, for which he was grateful.
The baseball game with Prospect Hill in the
afternoon had been a hard one, and the victory—for
Warwick had won in the tenth—had left him
rather tired, and he had passed up a lecture in the
school auditorium in favor of rest and solitude at
home. Which is why the knock on the door brought
a sigh and a frown. Of course, he might remain
silent, but the light shining through the transom
would be a give-away, and the caller might be
Trevor Corwin with his everlasting stamp album:
Trev was a sensitive kid and easily hurt. So Ted
laid down his magazine and said “Come in!” in
no very enthusiastic tone. To his relief, the visitor
was Hal Saunders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<p>“Hello, Bowman,” said Hal, glancing about the
study. “George around?” His eyes sought the
darkened bedroom as he closed the door behind
him.</p>

<p>“Gone home over Sunday,” replied Ted.</p>

<p>“Gone home!” Hal’s tone held so much of dismay
that Ted wondered.</p>

<p>“Yes, his father’s been sick for about a week or
so, and he got leave from faculty. Went right after
the game.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Hal worriedly. “He didn’t
say anything to me about it. I wish I’d known. I
want to see him about—something important.”
To Ted’s discomfiture he seated himself on the
window-seat and moodily stared at the lamp.
“When’s he coming back?”</p>

<p>“Monday. He got permission to cut morning
hours. I guess he will be on the twelve-forty-six.”</p>

<p>“That’ll be too late,” said Hal aggrievedly. “By
Jove, that’s rotten! I don’t see why he couldn’t
let folks know he was going.”</p>

<p>Evidently overwhelmed by the news, he made
no move to depart. He was a good-looking fellow
of sixteen, well-made, tall and lithe, with light
hair and eyes and a fair complexion which even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
three months of baseball had failed to darken. In
contrast, the boy in the Morris chair was a year
younger, shorter, heavier, more compact, with dark
eyes and hair and a face which, if not handsome,
was rather attractive in spite of the fact that sun
and weather had tanned it to the hue of leather
and that the tip of the nose was peeling. Both boys
were members of the School Nine, Ted being right
fielder and Hal first-choice pitcher. They were not,
however, very good friends. Ted thought Hal
traded too much on his ability as a twirler. It was
undeniable that he was an exceptionally good one,
perhaps the best that the school had ever had, but in
Ted’s opinion Hal would do well to forget the fact
now and then. He didn’t understand what his
room-mate, George Tempest, saw in Hal to admire;
that is, beyond his playing. Naturally George,
being captain of the team, would feel kindly toward
a chap who so often pitched to victory, but he
needn’t overdo it! Ted was fond of his room-mate
and so it is possible that jealousy had something
to do with his mild dislike of Hal Saunders.</p>

<p>Presently Hal raised his eyes from a frowning
contemplation of his shoes and Ted was surprised
at the trouble shown in his face. It was a most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
unusual thing for the self-satisfied, rather superior
Hal Saunders to exhibit anything approaching discomposure.
In spite of himself, Ted’s sympathies
were touched. “Was it something about the
Team?” he asked.</p>

<p>Hal shook his head. “No, it was—something——”
He hesitated. Then: “I wanted to
borrow some money from him.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” murmured Ted. It was, he reflected, a
lot like Hal to make a fuss about an unimportant
matter like that. Perhaps the other read the
thought, for he suddenly said defensively:</p>

<p>“I’m in a dickens of a hole, Bowman, and I was
pretty sure that George could help me out. Now
I’m blessed if I know what to do!”</p>

<p>“Won’t Monday do?”</p>

<p>“Monday morning might, but Monday afternoon
will be too late—unless——” Hal fell into silence
again. Ted wondered if Hal was trying to find
courage to ask him for a loan. He almost hoped
so. It would be rather a pleasure to refuse it.
“It’s Plaister, in the village,” Hal went on after
a moment. “He’s got a bill of twelve dollars and
eighty cents against me. I’ve been owing the old
skinflint some of it since last year. And now he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
says that if it isn’t paid by to-night he will go and
get the money from ‘Jerry.’ And you know what
that will mean!”</p>

<p>Ted did know. “Jerry” was the popular name
for Doctor Morris, the Principal, and when “Jerry”
learned that Hal had transgressed the very strict
rule against having bills at the village stores, punishment
would be swift and stern. Why, Hal
might be dismissed from school! The very least
that would happen to him would be probation!</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s just bluffing,” offered Ted, but with
little conviction in his voice.</p>

<p>“No such luck,” answered Hal. “He’s threatened
twice before and I’ve begged him off. This time
he means it. I found a letter from him in the
mail this noon. I was going to speak to George
before the game, but there wasn’t any chance, and
I—I sort of funked it anyway. Besides, I thought
there was time enough. Plaister won’t do anything
until Monday. I was pretty sure George had the
money and I guess he’d have let me have it. I
meant to beat it over to the village right after
chapel Monday morning. I hadn’t any idea he was
going away!”</p>

<p>“Too bad,” said Ted, more than half meaning it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
“How the dickens did you ever manage to run up
a bill like that, Saunders?”</p>

<p>Hal shrugged. “Oh, I don’t know. I’m always
buying fool things. Plaister was keen enough to
charge ’em until he had a nice big bill against me.
Afterwards, too. It got so I was afraid not to
buy anything he showed me for fear he’d ask me
to pay up.”</p>

<p>“But you get an allowance——”</p>

<p>“A dollar a week,” said Hal slightingly. “How
far does that go? Mother sends me a little now
and then. If she didn’t I wouldn’t have a cent in
my pocket, ever. I’m a fool about money, and
dad knows it. And he will know it a heap better
about next Tuesday!”</p>

<p>“But look here, Saunders. Won’t Plaister stand
to lose if he goes to ‘Jerry?’ Faculty always says
that shop-keepers giving credit to the fellows will
be deprived of the school trade. Seems to me
Plaister will think twice before he risks that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he will tell some hard-luck yarn and ‘Jerry’
will believe him. You know how ‘Jerry’ is. Barks
a lot, but doesn’t bite much. Yes, he might be
scared to do what he threatens, but his letter
sounded mighty earnest. He’s got me going, anyway.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
I say, Bowman, I don’t suppose you—er—happen
to have ten dollars you’d let me have? I’d
have to pay it back fifty cents a week, but——”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” said Ted, shaking his head. To his
surprise he found that he really was sorry—a little.
Hal’s gloom enwrapped him again.</p>

<p>“No, I suppose not. And I don’t guess you’d
care much about lending to me if you had it. You
don’t particularly love me. Well, I guess I’ll
toddle.” He arose and stood uncertainly a moment
before he moved toward the door.</p>

<p>“What will you do?” asked Ted anxiously.
“If—if you get put on ‘pro’ we’ll be in a nasty
fix! Hang it, Saunders, you’ve got to do something,
you know. Crouch would last about two
innings in the Temple game! Why don’t you see
Plaister to-morrow and get him to wait another
week? After next Saturday it wouldn’t matter.”</p>

<p>“I’ve talked to him until I’m tired,” replied Hal
wearily. “It’s no good. Maybe he won’t do it,
or maybe I can scrape up the money by Monday.
I’m tired worrying about it. I’d just as lief get
fired as have this thing hanging over me all the
time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>“Maybe he would take part of it and wait for the
rest.”</p>

<p>“He won’t. I tried that. He says he’s waited
long enough and—oh, a lot of drivel. You know
the way they talk. Well, good-night. And say,
Bowman, just keep this to yourself, like a good
chap, will you? I don’t know why I bothered you
with it, but I’d rather you didn’t say anything
about it.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. I won’t talk. Good-night. I
hope you—come out all right.”</p>

<p>Hal nodded dejectedly and went. Ted took up
his magazine, but after finding his place in it he let
it drop once more. If Plaister did what he threatened,
and Ted knew the hard-featured little shop-keeper
well enough to feel pretty certain that he
would, it would be all up with Warwick’s chances
for the baseball championship that year. With Hal
Saunders in the points they might defeat Temple
Academy next Saturday. Without him they
couldn’t. Neither Crouch nor Bradford was good
enough to last three innings against the Blue’s hard-hitting
team. The knowledge brought real dismay
to Ted. Personally he wanted a victory for the
school team, but it was the thought of George’s disappointment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
that moved him most. George, like
every captain, had hoped and worked for a triumph
harder than any of the others. For Ted’s part,
he would go back next year, but this was George’s
last chance. Ted was miserably sorry for his friend.
He was such a corking fine fellow. Ted recalled
the day last September when George, learning that
fate in the shape of faculty had wished a strange
and two years younger boy on him as room-mate,
had acted so mighty decent about it. Lots of fellows
in George’s place, thought Ted, would have
been mad and grouchy, but George had never let
Ted guess for a moment that he wasn’t entirely
welcome. And all through the year George had
been a perfect brick. He had helped Ted in many
ways: had got him into Plato Society, helped him at
mid-year exams, introduced him to nice fellows,
coached him in batting until he had become proficient
enough to beat out Whipple for right field
position. Ted’s feeling for George Tempest was a
mingling of gratitude and hero-worship that
amounted to a very real affection, and the thought
of George’s unhappiness in case the final game of
the school year went against Warwick troubled him
greatly. Temple Academy had routed Warwick<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
overwhelmingly last year and the sting of that defeat
still remained. Warwick wanted revenge, and her
three hundred and odd students had their hearts
set on obtaining it next Saturday. But to none did
it mean quite what it meant to Captain Tempest.
Ted tossed the magazine aside and stood up. “Something
ought to be done,” he muttered.</p>

<p>In the bedroom he produced a small tin box from
its hiding place in a dresser drawer and emptied the
contents on his bed. Three one-dollar bills and
many silver coins, when counted, came to exactly
fourteen dollars and seventy-five cents. He had
been accumulating the hoard ever since Fall with the
intention of buying a bicycle when he went home in
the Summer. When he had about five dollars more
he would have enough. He hadn’t told Hal that
he didn’t have the money. He had merely politely
refused to make a loan. And he had no idea of
changing his mind. Hal’s fix was no affair of his,
and Hal could get out of it as best he might. Certainly
he couldn’t be expected to give up a whole
Summer’s fun for the sake of a fellow he didn’t
like much anyway! Resolutely he placed the money
back in the box and the box again in concealment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
“He will wriggle out of it somehow,” he said to
himself.</p>

<p>Sunday was rainy and seemed weeks long, and
Ted missed George horribly. He saw Hal Saunders
at dinner and again in the evening, and it was apparent
from Hal’s countenance that he had not yet
found a way out of his difficulty. Ted went over
to the library after supper feeling very angry with
Hal, angry because that youth had endangered the
success of the nine, because his foolishness was in a
fair way to bring grief to George, and because he
had somehow managed to make one Ted Bowman
distinctly uncomfortable! Ted surrounded himself
with reference books, but all the work he did
scarcely paid for the effort.</p>

<p>Ted did not say anything to George, when the
latter returned on Monday, about Hal’s affairs.
After dinner that day he received a summons to the
Office, and although conscious of a clear conscience
he couldn’t help feeling a trifle uneasy as he obeyed
it. One didn’t get an invitation to confer with
“Jerry” unless the matter was one of some importance.
Events subsequently justified the uneasiness,
for when Ted closed the Office door behind him the
second time he was on probation!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>He could have stood his misfortune better had
George been decently sympathetic, but George was
disgusted and mad clear through. “You’ve no right
to do silly stunts when you’re on the team,” he
stormed. “You’ve got a duty toward the School.
A fine thing, isn’t it, to get on ‘pro’ four days
before the big game?”</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t think I <em>asked</em> for it, do you?”
demanded Ted indignantly. “Don’t you suppose I
wanted to play Saturday just as much as anyone?”</p>

<p>“Then you might have behaved yourself. You
know perfectly well that Billy Whipple can’t hit the
way you can. What did you do, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much. I didn’t really do anything, only
‘Jerry’ thinks I did and I can’t—can’t prove that I
didn’t!”</p>

<p>“That’s likely,” grunted George. “You must
have done something.”</p>

<p>“All right, then, I did. Anyhow, it doesn’t matter
whether I did or didn’t. I’m out of the game. I’m
sorry——”</p>

<p>George withered him with a look and slammed
the door as he went out.</p>

<p>After that life was hardly worth living, Ted
thought. George scarcely spoke to him and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
rest of his former team-mates were not much more
cordial. In fact the whole school apparently viewed
him as a traitor, and he felt like one. Thursday
morning Dr. Morris announced that hereafter the
students were not to make purchases at Plaister’s,
and Ted found a certain ungenerous comfort in the
shop-keeper’s misfortune. In the afternoon, while
he was studying in his room—he had avoided the
ball field since Monday—Hal came in with George.
For some reason Hal appeared to view Ted more
leniently than the other players did, perhaps because,
having so nearly attained probation himself,
he had sympathy for a brother offender. Hal’s
greeting was almost cordial. George’s was only a
grunt. Ted pretended to study, but he was really
listening to the talk of the others. Presently Hal
said indignantly:</p>

<p>“I wonder what they’ve got against Plaister,
George. It’s a shame to shut down on him like
that.”</p>

<p>“Some chap’s run up a bill, probably,” answered
George indifferently. “Faculty was after him last
year for giving credit.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sorry. The old codger’s mighty white,
and I ought to know it if anybody should. I owed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
him something over twelve dollars, some of it since
last year, and he came down on me hard last week
and said that if I didn’t pay right up he’d go to
‘Jerry.’ He had me scared stiff, and that’s no
dream! I had visions of being fired, or at least put
on ‘pro,’ and so I came over here Saturday night
to see if I could get some money from you. I had
only about two dollars to my name. But you had
gone home. Bowman offered to loan it to me”—Hal
winked at Ted’s startled countenance and
grinned—“but I wouldn’t take it. I tried at least a
dozen other fellows, but every last one was stoney
broke. I expected all day Monday to get an invitation
to the Office——”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I wasn’t here,” interrupted George
regretfully. “I could have fixed you up. Better let
me do it now.”</p>

<p>“Not for anything,” laughed Hal. “You see the
old chap never showed up and I had my nervous
prostration for nothing. All he did do was to send
me the bill Tuesday morning—receipted!”</p>

<p>“Receipted!”</p>

<p>“Yep, paid in full! Just scratched it right off his
books. I suppose he thought he might as well.
Afraid to get in wrong with faculty, maybe. Still,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
it was pretty decent of him, wasn’t it? Of course
I’ll pay him as soon as I can, but he doesn’t know
that.”</p>

<p>George agreed that it was decent indeed, but he
looked somewhat puzzled. The incident didn’t tally
at all with his conception of Mr. Jabed Plaister.</p>

<p>Saturday dawned breathlessly hot, and the game,
set for two o’clock, was postponed until three. The
wait was hard on the nerves of the players, and
Billy Whipple, who was to play right field in place
of Ted, was plainly unsettled. Ted knew of no reason
why he should not enjoy the painful pleasure
of watching the game, and so, when Loring, the
Temple Academy pitcher, wound himself up for the
first delivery, Ted was seated cross-legged under
the rope behind third base with a very disconsolate
expression on his perspiring countenance. To-day
the consciousness of virtue failed more than ever to
atone for his being out of the game. He strove to
find consolation in the reflection that there was
another year coming, but the attempt was a flat
failure.</p>

<p>The heat had its effect on spectators and players
alike. The cheering and singing lacked “pep” and
the rival teams comported themselves as though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
their one desire was to get back to the shade of
the benches. Ted glowered and muttered at the
slowness of the contest. In the first two innings
only a long fly by the Temple second baseman that
was neatly captured by Whipple and a couple of inexcusable
and innocuous errors livened the dreariness
of the game. The third inning began like the
preceding ones but promised better when, in the last
half of it, Warwick got a man to second on the
first clean hit of the game. The Brown’s cheerers
came to life then and, although the next batter
fouled to catcher, making the second out, Warwick
paid for the vocal encouragement by putting the first
run across on a hit past third.</p>

<p>Temple got men on third and second bases in the
first of the fourth and tried hard to bring them
home, but Hal Saunders, having allowed a hit and
walked a batsman, retrieved himself and saved the
situation by knocking down a hard liner that was
well above his head. Very coolly and leisurely he
picked it up, while the man on third scuttled to the
plate, and threw out the batsman at first.</p>

<p>The fifth inning went better. The air had cooled
perceptibly and both Hal and Loring were now
twirling real ball and the game was becoming a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
pitchers’ battle pure and simple. When Hal got
down to business, hits became as scarce as hen’s
teeth, nor was Loring much behind him in effectiveness
to-day. Batters stepped to the plate, swung or
waited and retired with trailing bat. One-two-three
was the order. The game went into the seventh with
Warwick’s one-run lead looking very large. Ted,
his disappointments forgotten, was “rooting” hard
and tirelessly behind third. Temperature was now a
matter of no moment. Warwick was ahead, Hal
was mowing ’em down and victory was hovering
above the brown banner!</p>

<p>It was in her half of the seventh that Temple
evened up the score. With two gone and first base
inviolate Temple’s third man up, her chunky little
tow-headed shortstop whose clever playing had frequently
won applause from friend and foe, waited
cannily and let Hal waste two deliveries. Then he
swung at a wide one and missed. The next was
another ball, although it cut the corner of the plate,
and, with the score against him, Hal tried to bring
the tow-headed youth’s agony to a merciful end by
sneaking over a fast and straight one. But the shortstop
outguessed him that time. There was a mighty
<em>crack</em> and away arched the ball. And away sped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
the batsman. Probably he had small hope of safety,
for the sphere was making straight for the right
fielder, but he knew enough not to jump to conclusions.
Which is why, when the ball bounded from
Whipple’s hands, the runner was almost at second.
Urged on by the delighted coaches, he slid into third
a few inches ahead of the ball.</p>

<p>What caused Whipple’s error I do not know.
He had the sun in his eyes, of course, but he had
made a harder catch under like circumstances in the
second inning. But better men than young Whipple
have done the same and so we needn’t waste time
trying to find an excuse for him. The mischief was
done, and four minutes later the Temple captain
had tied up the score with a Texas Leaguer back
of third.</p>

<p>There were no more hits in the seventh and none
in the eighth. In the ninth Temple almost won by
a scratch and an error after Hal had lammed an inshoot
against a batsman’s ribs and he had reached
second on a sacrifice bunt. But the error, while it
took him to third, did no more, and Hal settled down
and struck out his tenth man.</p>

<p>Warwick got one runner to second in her half,
but he died there and the contest went into extra<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
innings. By this time the sun was behind the trees
at the edge of the field and a faint breeze was stirring.
Ted was parched of throat and hoarse of
voice and was alternately hopeful and despairing.
The tenth inning went the way of the others. Hal
had two more strike-outs to his credit and Loring
one. In the eleventh the strain began to show. Hal
passed the first man up, the second hit safely, the
third struck out, the fourth laid down a bunt in
front of the plate. Temple shouted and raved in
delight. But Hal was still master. Another strike-out
averted the threatened disaster. Warwick went
in in her half with Captain Tempest up. George
tried hard to deliver, but made an easy out, third
to first. The next batter had no better luck. The
third was Billy Whipple. Billy was known as a fair
batsman, although to-day he had signally failed.
Maybe Loring eased up a trifle. If so he produced
his own disaster, for Billy picked out the second delivery
and everlastingly whanged it!</p>

<p>In Ted’s words, it went where it would do the
most good. It fell to earth twenty feet short of
the gymnasium steps and ten feet beyond the center
fielder’s eager hands. Billy didn’t make the circuit
because George Tempest himself, coaching behind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
third, blocked his path to the plate. There was a
howl at that, for it did seem that Billy might have
made it. But playing it safe won out for once, for
Loring was a bit shaken by that blow at his record
and Warwick’s next batter hit safely between second
and shortstop and Billy romped home. That ended
the scoring in that inning, but the Brown was again
in the lead and Warwick shouted and chanted.</p>

<p>Ted, realizing the effort Temple would make to
even things up in the twelfth, and knowing that the
head of her batting list was up, was on tenter-hooks.
Warwick had the victory in her grasp if she could
only hold it. But Hal had been showing signs of
fatigue the last two innings and there had been a
perceptible let-down. Ted anxiously took counsel
with himself. Then he jumped to his feet and ran
around to the home bench. Hal, his face rather
drawn and plastered with dust in the wrinkles, was
pulling on his glove when Ted reached him.</p>

<p>“Saunders,” said Ted breathlessly, “if you can
hold ’em we’ve got the game!”</p>

<p>Hal viewed him with disgust and weariness.
“You surprise me,” he replied, with a weak attempt
at sarcasm.</p>

<p>Ted laid a hand on the other’s arm and took a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
firm grip there. “Cut out the mirth,” he said. “You
go in and pitch ball, Saunders. Get me? Don’t
you dare let up for a second. If we——”</p>

<p>Hal shook him off. “What’s wrong with you?”
he demanded. “Sun-stroke? You’re a fine one to
make cracks like that! Beat it, kid!”</p>

<p>“Listen to me,” said Ted earnestly, dropping his
voice. “If Temple wins this game I’ll go to ‘Jerry’
and tell him what I know. I mean it, Saunders!”</p>

<p>“Why, you little rotter!” gasped the pitcher.</p>

<p>“That’s all right. You heard me. You pitch
ball, Saunders!”</p>

<p>“I’m going to,” sputtered the other, “and when
I get through I’m going to knock your silly block
off. Now get out of my way!”</p>

<p>Ted went back to his place well satisfied. Saunders
was mad clean through and Saunders would
pitch real ball! And Saunders did. Not since the
game had started had he worked more carefully,
more craftily, and although he had three hard hitters
to put aside he never faltered. Up came the
Temple third baseman—and back again to the bench.
The Blue’s captain followed him and, although
he brought Ted’s heart into his mouth four times
by knocking fouls, he, too, had to acknowledge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
defeat. Temple was frantic now as she saw defeat
impending. For luck she sent a substitute player in
for the third batsman and Hal promptly put his
first two deliveries across for strikes while triumphant
Warwick howled with delight. Then a
ball, and another one, and——</p>

<p>“<em>He’s</em> OUT!” cried the umpire.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was after eight. The riotous celebration had
dwindled to mere sporadic outbursts of joy out on
the campus. Ted was talking with George on the
window-seat in their study. The victory had put
the captain in high spirits and since dinner he had
returned to the old footing with his room-mate.
They had talked the game over from first play to
last, and Ted, happy in the renewal of friendly relations,
was seeking a fresh topic lest George
should become bored with his society and go away
when there was a knock at the door and Hal strode
in. Recalling the threat he had made, Ted viewed
his appearance with some apprehension, but Hal
showed no intention of removing Ted’s “block” in
the designated manner.</p>

<p>“I got something to show you fellows,” announced
Hal, striding across to the window. “Look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
here. Read that. No, wait a minute till I tell you.”
He drew back the sheet of paper he had thrust toward
George. “I thought it would be only the
decent thing if I thanked Plaister for cancelling
that account, see? So yesterday I wrote a nice little
note and mailed it to him. This is what I got in
answer. Found it in my room after supper. Read
it out loud, George.”</p>

<p>“‘Jabed Plaister, General Emporium, Dealer
in——’”</p>

<p>“Never mind that,” interrupted Hal impatiently.
“Read the writing.”</p>

<p>“If I can,” agreed George. “Let’s see. ‘Dear
Sir: Yours of like date to hand. I gave the other
boy a receipted bill and I don’t know what you are
talking about unless you are trying to get funny
and I’ll tell you plain there’s a law for such as you.
And if you hadn’t paid I would have seen your
principle just like I said I was. Lucky for you you
did. Respectfully, Jabed Plaister.’ Not so very
respectful, either! Well, what about it, Hal?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you see? Someone paid that bill. I
didn’t. Who did? That’s what I came here to find
out.” He turned suddenly to Ted. “Did you?” he
demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>Ted stared back blankly.</p>

<p>“Did you?” insisted Hal. “You <em>did</em>! What for?
Why——”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t said so,” interposed George.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t need to. He isn’t denying it, is he?
Besides, he knew about it. Look here, Bowman, I’m
much obliged, of course, and all that, but I don’t
understand why—after you’d refused me that
night——”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ted at last, slowly, seemingly seeking
inspiration from his shoes, “I knew that if you
got fired or put on probation and couldn’t pitch to-day
we’d get licked. I—I ought to tell you frankly,
I guess, that I didn’t do it on your account, Saunders.
There was the School to consider, and—and
George. I knew he’d be all broke up if we
lost the game. I had the money put away for—for
something, and so I decided that if Plaister was
really going to make trouble I’d pay him. I met
him on the road Monday morning right after breakfast.
I tried to get him to take five dollars, but
he wouldn’t, and so I paid it all and he gave me
the receipted bill. I ought to have told you at once,
but—well, I was sort of peeved at you and I didn’t.
Finally, when it got to be supper time and I hadn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
told you, I was ashamed to, and so I stuck the bill
in an envelope and put it in the mail. That’s all;
except that someone—I guess it was ‘Granny’ Lockwood:
he’s always mooning around the landscape—saw
me give the money to Plaister and told
‘Jerry.’”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence. Then George
said: “But you could have told ‘Jerry’ the truth,
Ted.”</p>

<p>“What good would that have done? He’d have
put Saunders on ‘pro,’ and that’s just what I was
working against. Don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“Mighty white,” muttered Hal.</p>

<p>“I wish you had told me, Ted,” said George. “I
talked a good deal of rough stuff. I’m sorry, kid.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Ted. “You didn’t know.
You see, I’d promised Saunders not to talk
about it.”</p>

<p>“Bowman, you’re a perfect brick,” exclaimed Hal.
“I know you didn’t do it on my account, but you
got me out of a beast of a hole, and—and I’m
mighty grateful. And you’ll get that money back
just as soon as I get home. I’ll tell dad the whole
story and he’ll come across, never fear. Of course
I’ll have to promise to keep inside my allowance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
after this, but I guess I’m about ready to, anyhow.
Last Monday I’d have promised anything! And
I’ll see ‘Jerry’ at once——”</p>

<p>“There is no sense in doing that,” interrupted
Ted. “There’s only four more days of school and
I don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“But you’re in wrong with faculty——”</p>

<p>“Not very. ‘Jerry’ was awfully decent. Said my
record was so good he wouldn’t be hard on me.
There’s no use in his owning up, is there, George?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think there is,” answered George
after a moment’s consideration. “Ted’s taken your
punishment and you’ve learned your lesson—I
hope.”</p>

<p>“I have,” agreed Hal, emphatically. “But it
doesn’t seem fair to—to Ted. He was done out
of playing, and a lot of fellows think hardly of
him——”</p>

<p>“Shucks,” said Ted, “I don’t mind. You fellows
know how it was, and the others will forget
by next Fall. And we won. I’m satisfied.”</p>

<p>“We won,” said George, “because of what you
did, Ted, and for no other reason. I don’t see any
way to give you credit for it without getting Hal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
into trouble, but there’s one thing I can do, and I’m
going to do it.”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Ted uneasily.</p>

<p>“See that you get your W.”</p>

<p>“Bully!” applauded Hal. “Only, do you think
you really can? If Ted didn’t play——”</p>

<p>“Who says he didn’t?” demanded George. “He
must have. It was his play that won!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TGP">THE GREAT PECK</h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Eight of us were in Pete Rankin’s room that
night, all freshies and all candidates for the
’21 football team, unless you except this fellow
Harold Peck that I’m telling you about. Jim
Phelan had brought him along, because, he said, he
looked lonesome. Jim had planned to room with a
chap he had chummed with at Hollins, but he had
failed in exams and faculty had stung him with Peck.
That’s one drawback to rooming in the yard at
Erskine: you can’t always choose your roommate.
Peck was sort of finely cut, with small, well-made
features, dark hair and eyes and a good deal of
color in his face. And he was a swell little dresser.
Rather an attractive kid, on the whole, and maybe
a year younger than most of us there. He didn’t
make much of a splash that night, though, for he
just sat quiet on Pete’s trunk and looked interested
and polite. Being polite was Peck’s specialty. I
never knew a chap with more different ways of
thanking you or begging your pardon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>We were mostly Hollins or Enwright fellows,
and we were there to get the freshman football
team started. Dave Walker, the Varsity captain,
dropped in for a few minutes and helped us out;
and after he had gone again we got to talking about
our chances of turning out a good enough eleven
to beat the Robinson freshies, and who would play
where, and one thing and another, and presently
Bob Saunders, who had played half for Enwright
last year, asked: “What have we got for quarterback
material, fellows?”</p>

<p>Trask, another Enwright chap, said: “Kingsley,”
but no one enthused. Tom Kingsley had been a
second choice quarter on Trask’s team and had been
fairly punk, we Hollins crowd thought. Pete Rankin
yawned and said he guessed we’d find a couple
of decent quarters all right, and Jim Phelan said,
sure, you can always catch a quarter when he was
young and train him.</p>

<p>“I think I’d like to try that job,” I said. “I guess
it’s easier than playing tackle. You don’t have to
exert yourself. You just shove the ball to someone
else. It’s a cinch!”</p>

<p>“You’d make a swell little quarterback,” laughed
Pete. “You’re just built for it, Joe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I’m down to a hundred and eighty-one and
a half——”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I ever saw a crackerjack quarter,”
Jim Phelan butted in, “who wasn’t sort of small.
Did you, Pete? Remember Warner, of two years
ago? He was my notion of a properly built lad for
the quarter. Wasn’t he a wonder?” Pete said yes,
and “Toots” Hanscom, who will take either end of
any argument you can start, tried to prove Jim all
wrong, and then everyone took a hand. But Jim is
stubborn, and he hung out for the small kind. “Take
a chap like—well, like Peck there. If he knows the
game he will play all around your heavy man or
your tall one.”</p>

<p>Everyone turned to size Peck up, and he looked
embarrassed, and Toots sniffed and asked him his
weight.</p>

<p>“About a hundred and forty-two, I think,” said
Peck.</p>

<p>“Thought so. He’d have a swell chance, Jim,
against those husky Robinson freshies!”</p>

<p>“Sure he would,” answered Jim, stoutly. “I
don’t say he’d be a marvel at plugging the line, but
I do say that if Peck was a football man a good
coach could take hold of him and make a rattling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
good quarter of him. It isn’t beef that counts in a
quarter, Toots. It’s brains and pep and knowledge
of football.”</p>

<p>“Piffle! Peck wouldn’t last five minutes!”</p>

<p>“Better induce Mr. Peck to come out,” suggested
Monty Fellows. “Then we can see who’s right.”</p>

<p>Jim started to hedge. “I didn’t say Peck was the
man. I said a fellow of his size and build. Peck
isn’t a football player, and so it wouldn’t prove anything
if he tried it.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you ever played at all, Mr. Peck?”
asked Pete.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, thanks,” replied Peck. “We had a
rather good football team at my school and I—er—I
tried for it year before last. But, of course, I was
pretty light, you see——”</p>

<p>“You could soon beef up, I’d say,” said Pete.
“Maybe you’d have better luck this time. Had you
thought of it?”</p>

<p>“Why—why, I did mention it to Phelan, but he
thought I’d better wait until I was a bit
heavier——”</p>

<p>Everyone laughed at Jim then, and Jim tried to
explain that he hadn’t thought of Peck as a quarter.
“Just the same,” he said stoutly, “I wish he would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
come out and try for the position. I’ll risk it! I’ll
bet he will make good! Come on, now, what price
Peck?”</p>

<p>“Oh, really,” began Peck, “you mustn’t hope
much of me, Phelan! You see——”</p>

<p>“That’s all right! You agree to try for the quarterback
position and do as you’re told and work
hard and——”</p>

<p>“And grow a few inches,” said Toots slyly.</p>

<p>“And I’ll guarantee that you’ll be third-string
quarter or better by the end of the season! What
do you say?”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s very flattering,” answered Peck, looking
around and smiling deprecatingly. He had a
nice smile, had Peck. “But I’d be awfully afraid of
disappointing you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll risk that,” said Jim. “You show up to-morrow
at three-thirty, then.”</p>

<p>Peck murmured something that sounded like consent
and Jimmy Sortwell asked: “Where is your
home, Mr. Peck?”</p>

<p>“Winstead, Maryland.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Jimmy. “I asked because I wondered
if you were any relation to the Peck who played
on the Elm Park High School team last year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>“What is his first name, please?” asked Peck.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I ever heard it. I never met
him, but the team came on from Chicago last
December and played a post season game with one
of the Boston teams and licked the stuffing out of
them. This fellow Peck was quarter, and he was
a wonder. Don’t you fellows remember reading
about him? Some of the papers in the East here
made him All-Scholastic quarter, and that’s going
some, for they hate to name anyone west of
Albany!”</p>

<p>“Seems to me I remember something about a remarkable
quarter on some Western team that played
around here last year,” agreed Pete. “Don’t recall
his name, though.”</p>

<p>“It was probably this fellow I’m telling of. He
wasn’t much bigger than you, either, Peck, I’d say.
Perhaps a little heavier, eight or ten pounds. He
was a stunning player, though, a regular marvel.
And that sort of helps out your contention, Jim.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I have any relatives in the West,”
said Peck. “Of course, there might be some distant
ones——”</p>

<p>“Well, if you take after your namesake,”
laughed Burton Alley, “we won’t kick a mite!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Peck, “but, of course, you
mustn’t expect much of me. There’s a great deal
to learn about football.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s more to it than croquet,” said
Toots dryly, “but don’t let that scare you. With
Jim looking after you you ought to get along fine!”</p>

<p>“Really, do you think so?” asked Peck, gratefully.
“Thank you ever so much!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We had a whooping big freshman class that year
and didn’t expect much trouble in finding all the
material we needed. But we had reckoned without
the war. A lot of fellows were so full of it that they
couldn’t see football. There was talk of introducing
military training at Erskine, too, and although that
didn’t come until later, there was a lot of excitement
over it. Of course, we were all strong for the military
stuff, but some of us couldn’t see the necessity
for making the world safe for Democracy before
we had knocked the tar out of the Robinson freshmen.
It was more than a week after college had
started when we finally got four full squads together.
The Athletic Committee assigned us a
Graduate School chap named Goss as coach. He
had played tackle for Erskine three years before.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
We didn’t cheer for him much at first, but he turned
out fine. He wasn’t much on the up-to-the-minute
stuff, but he was a corking tactician and hard as
nails when it came to discipline. And he was so set
on teaching the rudiments before the frills that we
were soon calling him “Old Rudy.”</p>

<p>Faculty held us down to a six-game schedule,
which was a shame, for we could have licked any
team of our weight in New England. Besides, the
Varsity was all shot to pieces, because so many last
year men had enlisted, and was a sort of a joke,
and we always took the crowds away from her. We
were really the big noise that Fall and should have
been allowed a decent schedule. Of course, every
good team has its troubles, and ours began after
the Connellsville game. We beat her, all right, but
she laid up two of our best linesmen and proved
that neither Kingsley nor Walker was the right man
for quarter. We had two other candidates for the
position in Ramsey and Peck. There wasn’t much
to choose between them, it looked; only Peck had a
good press agent and Ramsey hadn’t. Jim Phelan
was still backing his roommate strong. Toots
Hanscom told us that Jim was coaching Peck for
an hour every evening. Said he dropped into their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
room in McLean one night and found Jim holding
the book on Harold and putting him through a regular
exam! Anyhow, Peck was certainly coming all
the time, and when we met the Taylor freshies the
next Saturday he had his chance in the third period.
He got mixed a couple of times, but I couldn’t see
any signs of nervousness, and he surely made us
hump ourselves. And he played his position mighty
well besides. Jim certainly had no kick coming
against his pupil, for Peck played good football that
day, barring those two mistakes in signals, and
ended up in the last three or four minutes with as
pretty a forward pass to Trask as you’d want to see.
Trask didn’t quite make the goal line, though, and
so we accepted our first defeat, Taylor nosing out
12 to 11. But we’d played good ball, and we knew
it, and the school knew it. And you can bet that
Taylor knew it, too, for she was just about all in
when the whistle sounded.</p>

<p>Peck got quite a lot of kind words that day,
and Jim Phelan went around saying “What did I
tell you?” and making himself generally obnoxious.
But that didn’t win Peck the quarterback position,
for Kingsley was still the better man, especially
when he was going well, and young Peck went back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
to the second squad Monday, and Jim spoke darkly
of “bonehead coaches.” More trouble developed
that week: Wednesday, I think it was. Pete Rankin—I
forgot to say that we’d elected him captain
without much opposition from the Enwright crowd—hurt
his knee in a scrimmage and had to lay off.
And one or two other chaps went wunky and so
Townsend Tech didn’t have much trouble with us,
three days later. Kingsley started at quarter and
Peck didn’t get a show until the last of the third
period. Then he played the same nice game he’d
played the week before and speeded us up so that
we managed to score our second touchdown. And,
considering that we had six second- or third-string
fellows in the line-up by that time, that wasn’t so
poor. And 11 to 20 didn’t sound as bad as 7 to 20,
either. So Peck got the glad hand in the locker
room afterwards and old Rudy stopped him on his
way to the showers and spoke kind words.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>By that time the college was beginning to sit up
and take notice of Peck. Fellows asked where he’d
played before, what school he’d come from and so
on. No one seemed to know, and when you asked
Peck himself he was sort of vague, and so blamed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
polite that you didn’t have the crust to keep on asking.
But I made out that he’d skipped around between
two or three schools down Maryland way,
and I believed it until two things came off simultaneously.
The first was Peck’s sudden “arrival” in
football. It occurred the Thursday after the Townsend
fracas. Kingsley was suffering from shell
shock by reason of having been slammed around by
big Sanford, the Townsend fullback, in the third
quarter, and old Rudy started Peck when the scrimmage
began. Well, I don’t know what had got into
little Harold that day; or I didn’t know then. Afterward
I thought I had an inkling. Anyway, he was
a revelation. Pete Rankin said awedly that Peck
was a composite reincarnation of Eckersall and
Daly. So far as I know, those two old-timers are
still alive and kicking, but you get Pete’s idea. He
meant that Peck was a peach of a quarter that day;
and that goes double with me. We went up against
the Varsity scrubs, and they were a heavy, scrappy
bunch, even if they didn’t have much team play.
Peck seemed to sense just the sort of medicine that
would do ’em the most good, and he proceeded to
dose it out to them right from the kick-off. He
used Saunders and Hanscom for play after play<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
until we were down to the scrub’s twenty-yard line,
bringing Hanscom around from right end and busting
him through left tackle. He and Saunders were
light and quick, and they got the distance in three
plays regularly. Then, down on the twenty, he
switched to his other backs, Fellows and Curtis, and
piled ’em through to the two yards. The scrubs
pulled themselves together then, and two tries failed
and Peck gave the pass to Curtis for an overhead
heave to Saunders. But Bob was spilled in his
tracks and, with three to go and one down left,
Peck faked a try at goal and kited around his left
end with the pigskin cuddled under his elbow and
slipped across the line near the corner very nicely.</p>

<p>Four minutes later we scored again. The scrub’s
kick-off was short and I wrapped myself around it
and busted along for nearly twenty yards and landed
the ball on the forty. Then Saunders slipped up for
the first time and Peck tried a forward to Hanscom
that grounded. Curtis smashed through for four
and then Peck took the law into his own hands again
and, faking a pass to Saunders, hid the ball until
the scrubs were coming through. Then he found
his hole, slipped right through the middle of the line,
ducked and squirmed past the secondary defense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
and raced off straight for the goal. And believe
me, that kid could run! The scrub quarter was the
only man with any license to stop him, and Peck
fooled him near the thirty yards, and went right on
and placed old Mister Pigskin squarely between the
posts.</p>

<p>I’d got sort of roughly handled by the big mutts
when they stopped me after I’d caught the kick-off
and Old Rudy yanked me out, and so I didn’t see
any more of the scrimmage. But they said that
Peck kept it up right to the end, making another
corking run from near the scrub’s forty to her five,
and handling the team like a veteran. Monty Fellows,
who could spill language that would gag you
or me, said that Peck was inspired and that he had
“indubitably vindicated Phelan’s contention.” I
thought so, too, though not in just those words, and
so when I ran across Jim on the way to College
Hall after dinner that evening I started to hand him
a few bouquets. But he only grunted and looked
peeved, and I eased up and asked: “What’s jangling
your heart strings, Jim? I should think you’d be
pleased to see little Harold vindicating your—er—whatyoucallems.”
He sometimes called him Harold
to annoy Jim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>“You would, eh?” growled Jim.</p>

<p>“Sure I would! Haven’t you toiled with the kid
all Fall and taught him all he knows and everything?”</p>

<p>“I thought so,” said Jim significantly.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, thought so? Who else is
responsible? Of course, I’m not saying Peck
wouldn’t have learned football after a fashion even
if you hadn’t——”</p>

<p>Jim laughed harshly, like a villain in a play. “Say,
Joe, you do a lot of talking with your mouth sometimes,
but maybe you can keep a secret. Can you?”</p>

<p>“Secrecy’s my middle name. Shoot!”</p>

<p>And after a minute Jim shot. “He fooled me, all
right,” he began ruefully. “I thought he was as
green as grass and even when he’d learn a thing too
blamed quick to be natural I didn’t suspect. I said,
‘It’s just natural football instinct he’s got. You can’t
explain it any other way.’ Wasn’t I the bonehead?”</p>

<p>“Sure! But what——”</p>

<p>“Listen. This morning I wanted a collar stud.
Mine had rolled under the bed or somewhere and
it was late. So I pulled open Harold’s top drawer.
I knew he had a little fancy-colored box there where
he kept studs and things and as he had gone to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
breakfast I thought I’d just help myself to one.
What do you suppose was the first thing I saw when
I lifted the lid?”</p>

<p>“Great big snake?”</p>

<p>“Cut the comedy! One of these little gold footballs
you wear on your watch chain!”</p>

<p>“Well?” I asked, not catching the idea.</p>

<p>“There was engraving on it and I read what it
said. ‘E. P. H. S., 1917,’ Joe! What do you know
about that?”</p>

<p>“Still I don’t get you. What’s E. P. S. stand
for?”</p>

<p>“E. P. H. S., you dummy! Elm Park High
School! Don’t you remember Sortwell telling about
a fellow named Peck who’d played with Elm Park
and asking Harold if he was any relation?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said I. “Now I savvy! But, look here,
Jim, you don’t think Harold’s this Elm Park star!
Why, didn’t he say——”</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t,” answered Jim sourly. “He was
mighty careful not to. He said maybe Peck was
a distant relative or something. And he let me teach
him how to play quarterback! Must have had lots
of good laughs at me, eh? If I hadn’t been an utter
idiot I’d have tumbled to the truth long ago. Why,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
no one could pick up the game the way he has!
Look at the way he played to-day! He fooled the
whole bunch of us, anyway. I wasn’t the only
come-on. Only, why? What did he do it for?”</p>

<p>“Search me! But look here, what does he say?
Has he fessed up?”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t said anything because I haven’t. How
can I? Borrowing a chum’s collar stud is all right,
but when you run across something you’re not supposed
to know about you keep your mouth shut.
If I told him I was helping myself to a stud and
happened to see that gold football, what would he
think? He’d think I’d been snooping, of course.
But I don’t need to ask him. It’s as plain as a pike-staff.
That football is one of those given to the
members of last year’s victorious Elm Park team.
I looked up the record. They played eleven games
and won all but two. And Harold was quarterback
and was a regular James H. Dandy. And now
you know why I’m a trifle peeved, Joe. Wouldn’t
it set you back some to find that you’d been teaching
the fine points of football to last season’s All-Scholastic
quarterback?”</p>

<p>I said it would. Then I asked Jim what he was
going to do about it and he said glumly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>“I’m going to keep my mouth shut, and so are
you. What he wants is for us to find out we’ve
been fooled, so he can have the laugh on us. Nothing
doing! If he wants to come out as the Great
Peck he can do his own announcing. Then I’ll tell
him I knew it all along, and the laugh will be on
him, hang him!”</p>

<p>We chinned some more and then I left him. In
a way, thought I, it was sort of mean of Peck to
put it over on Jim like that, but at the same time
it was funny, and I had to chuckle a bit now and
then for the rest of the evening. It was a shame
not to tell the other fellows, too, but Jim had made
me promise to keep quiet and so I couldn’t. But
I got some fun out of it, for the next afternoon I
overhauled Harold going over to the field and I said
to him:</p>

<p>“It’s funny, but you remind me an awful lot of
that chap who played quarter for Elm Park last
year. You look a lot like him around the eyes.
And the lower part of his face, too. His name was
the same as yours, you know.”</p>

<p>“Really?” he asked, most polite. “Elm Park is
out near Chicago, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but the team came East last Fall for a post-season<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
game. You said you weren’t related to him,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I said just that,” replied the fox.
“I’d hardly dare to. As a matter of fact, our family
has relations in the West, although I’ve never
heard that any of them lived in Chicago.”</p>

<p>I didn’t want to give the snap away, so I shut
up then, but I couldn’t help admiring the way he
carried it off. Never batted an eyelash! Some boy,
Harold!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They made him first choice quarter then and he
was never headed all the rest of the season,
although Kingsley and Ramsey tried their hardest
to overhaul him, and he kept getting better and
better right up to the Robinson game, running the
team for all that was in it and never letting a game
go by without pulling off a few fancy stunts on his
own. I could see that there was a coolness between
him and Jim Phelan, but it seemed to me that Peck
was still unsuspecting that his secret was discovered.
So I guess he often wondered why Jim had stopped
giving him pointers and being chummy. Of course
they were still friendly and all that, but Jim couldn’t
forget that Harold had put one over on him. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
so things stood when we faced the Robinson freshmen
in the final game.</p>

<p>As the fellow said about the war, we had a good
day for it: cold and snappy, with almost no wind.
Robinson brought over a big bunch of rooters and
a good many of our own old boys came up for the
game. And there was a sprinkling of khaki, too,
for some of the grads were in service; and even the
Navy was represented by a Reserve lieutenant. He
was a corking looking chap, and when I ran across
him just after lunch he reminded me so much of
Harold Peck that for a minute I thought it was
Harold got up that way for a joke. But he was
bigger than Harold, and a couple of years older, I
guess, and when I’d had a second look at him the
resemblance wasn’t so strong. Still, it was there,
and when he stopped and asked me which was
McLean Hall his voice sort of sounded like Harold’s.
Anyway, he was a corking, clever-looking
lad, and I got to wondering how one of those blue
uniforms would look on yours truly.</p>

<p>I’m not going to bore you with the game in detail.
It was some game, but you’ve watched many better
ones. Robinson got the jump on us at the start
and scored a goal from our twenty-eight yards. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
guess we had stage fright or something, for we sure
played like a lot of kids in that first period. Even
Pete Rankin got temperamental and fell over his
own feet time and again, and young Peck tried hard
to show how not to play quarterback. But Robinson’s
score was just what we needed, for in the
second period we pulled ourselves together and
inched along for the goal line and finally pushed
Curtis over for a touchdown. We were pretty well
started on the way to a second when time was called
for the half. As Toots Hanscom had missed goal,
the score was 6–3 when we crawled back to the
gym. We thought we’d done pretty well until Old
Rudy started at us. Then we realized that we
weren’t much better than a gang of Huns. He certainly
did take the skin off! According to him Robinson
should never have scored and we should have
had twenty-one points tucked away. At that, he
wasn’t so far wrong, for we had surely pulled a lot
of dub plays in that first fifteen minutes. Anyhow,
when he’d got through with us we were ready to go
back and bite holes in the Robbies!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The third quarter gave us another touchdown,
and this time Toots booted it over. But Robinson<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
wasn’t dead yet, and she put a scare into us when
she sprang a new formation and began to circle our
ends for six and eight yards at a try. Pete was
put out of it and Gannet, who took his place, was
pretty punk. We lost two or three other first-string
men in that third period, and so when Robinson
worked down to our fifteen-yard line we couldn’t
stop her. We did smear her line attacks, but she
heaved a forward and got away with it, and kicked
the goal a minute later. That made the score 11
to 10, and the world didn’t look so bright for us.
And then, when the last quarter was about five minutes
old, Saunders, who was playing back with
Peck, let a punt go over his head and they had us
with our heels to the wall. Curtis punted on second
down and the ball went crazy and slanted out at
our forty-yard line. Robinson tried her kicks again
and came back slowly. Pete Rankin put himself
back in the game and that helped some. About that
time when the enemy was near our twenty-five,
Peck got a kick on the head and had to have time
out. Old Rudy started Kingsley to warming up on
the side line, but Peck, although sort of groggy, insisted
on staying in, and Pete let him.</p>

<p>They edged along to our twenty and then struck<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
a snag and that’s when I stopped taking much interest
in events, for I was the snag. When I came
around I was lying on a nice bank of hay, with
every bone in my head aching, and Prentiss was
playing my position. So what happened subsequently
was seen by little Joe from afar. Robinson
put another field goal over and added three points
to her score and we saw the game going glimmering.
There was still five minutes left, however,
and an optimist next to me on the hay pile said we
could do it yet. I didn’t think we could, but I liked
to hear him rave.</p>

<p>The five minutes dwindled to four and then to
three. We had the ball in the middle of the field
and were trying every play in our bag of tricks.
But our end runs didn’t get off, our forward passes
were spoiled and we were plainly up against it.
Young Peck’s voice got shriller and shriller and
Pete’s hoarser and hoarser, and the rooters were
making noises like a lot of frogs. And then the
timekeeper said one minute and it looked as though
there was nothing left but the shouting.</p>

<p>We still had the pigskin and had crossed the
center line two plays back, and Pete and Peck were
rubbing heads while the Robbies jeered. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
something broke loose, and after I’d got a good look
at it I saw that it was Peck.</p>

<p>I don’t know how he got away, for it looked as
if he had sort of pulled a miracle, but there he was,
dodging and streaking with the mob at his heels
and a quarter and a half laying for him up the field.
The optimist guy almost broke his hand off pounding
my sore shoulder and I let him pound, for the
pain helped me yell. Pete and Trask trailed along
behind Peck and it was Pete who dished the waiting
halfback. After that Peck had a free field and
it was only a question of his staying on his feet,
for you could see that the kid was all in. He got
to wobbling badly at about the fifteen yards and I
thought sure a Robinson chap had him, but the
Robbie wasn’t much better off and they finally went
across, staggering, with Peck just out of reach, and
toppled over the line together. Then bedlam broke
loose.</p>

<p>I must have forgotten my bum ankle, for the
next thing I knew I was down at the goal line with
half the college, and the Naval Reserve lieutenant
had Peck’s head on his knees and was telling Tracy,
the trainer, what to do for him. Tracy sputtered indignantly
and swashed his sponge and Toots missed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
another goal and the game was over. The crowd
got some of the team but I was near the gate and
made my getaway. And so did Peck, thanks to the
lieutenant chap, and we were halfway to the gym
before the fellows missed him. We fought them
off then right up to the gym door and dodged inside,
and Peck, who was all right now except for being
short of breath, said: “Thanks, West. I want you
to know my brother.”</p>

<p>“Your brother!” I gasped. The Navy chap
laughed and shook hands.</p>

<p>“And proud of it,” he said. “The kid played
good ball for a fellow who couldn’t make the team
last year, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t make—Say, what’s the idea?” I gibbered.
“Didn’t he play quarter for Elm Park?”</p>

<p>“Why, no,” said the Navy guy, “that was me!
Harold never played any to speak of until this fall.
He tells me that a roommate of his taught him
about all he knows. I want to meet that fellow!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said I, still sort of dazed. “Well, I guess
he will be mighty glad to meet you, too. You see,
he got it into his head that your brother was the
great Peck, and——”</p>

<p>“But I never told him anything like that!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
Harold. “Why, I even pretended I’d never
heard of you, Herb, for fear they might think I was—well,
trading on your reputation, don’t you see!
I don’t understand how Jim could have got that
idea!”</p>

<p>“Oh, he gets crazy notions sometimes,” said I.
“At that, though, he wasn’t so far off, because if
you’re not a Great Peck you’re a mighty good eight
quarts!”</p>

<p>Which wasn’t so poor for a fellow with half his
teeth loose! Now was it?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TCT">TERRY COMES THROUGH</h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">“You’re up next, Slim,” said Captain Fosdick,
leaning forward to speak to Maple
Park’s third baseman. “Get out there
and let ’em think you’re alive.” Whittier hoisted
himself from the bench and leisurely viewed the
row of bats. Selecting two, he ambled out toward
the plate. Guy Fosdick, or “Fos” as he was generally
called, turned again to Joe Tait, frowning.
Joe, a heavily-built, broad-shouldered boy of sixteen,
chuckled.</p>

<p>“It’s no use, Fos,” he said. “You can’t put pep
into Slim.”</p>

<p>Fos’s frown melted into a smile. He was a good-looking
chap at all times, but when he smiled he
“had it all over Apollo and Adonis and all the rest
of those Greek guys.” I am quoting Joe. Doubtless
Fos’s smile had a good deal to do with his
immense popularity at Maple Park School, a popularity
that had aided him to various honors during
his four years there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>“Sometimes I think he does it to rile me,” said
Fos. “The day they had the explosion in the chemical
laboratory Slim was out in front of Main Hall,
and still going, before any of the rest of us were
through the door! <em>Good boy, Archie!</em>” Browne
had slammed a grounder between Linton’s shortstop
and second baseman and filled the bags. “Two
gone,” he said regretfully. “If Slim doesn’t do
more than he’s been doing——” His voice trailed
off into silence as he gave his attention to the Linton
High School pitcher.</p>

<p>“Did you see Wendell get down to third?” asked
Joe admiringly. “That kid can certainly run!”</p>

<p>“Terry Wendell? Yes, he can,” agreed the captain
thoughtfully. “Put Terry on base and he will
get to third every time. He’s a fast one, all right.
But you’ve got to stop right there, Joe.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean, stop?”</p>

<p>“Terry never comes through. He gets just so
far and stops. I don’t know why. He got to first
on an error, stole second nicely, reached third on
Archie’s hit and I’ll bet you a red apple he will die
there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, Fos, you’re too hard on the kid. He’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
a pretty fair fielder and his hitting isn’t so rotten,
and you say yourself that he’s fast on the bases.”</p>

<p>“Until he gets to third,” responded Fos. “Maybe
next year Terry will make good, Joe, but he doesn’t
deliver the goods yet. I’m sorry, because he’s a
friend of yours——”</p>

<p>“We room together.”</p>

<p>“But I’ve got to let him go. He’s had a fair
trial all Spring, Joe, and the coach would have
dropped him two weeks ago if I hadn’t put in my
oar. He’s a nice kid, and he’s promising; but
promises won’t win from Lacon two weeks from
Saturday. If—— What did I tell you?”</p>

<p>There was a chorus of triumph from the knot of
Linton adherents behind third as their right fielder
pulled down Slim Whittier’s long fly, and Captain
Fosdick jumped up.</p>

<p>“But that wasn’t Terry’s fault,” protested Joe.
“A fellow can’t score on a third out!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say it was ever his fault,” replied Fos,
pulling on his glove. “But it’s what always happens,
Joe. He doesn’t come through. Call it hard
luck if you like, but that’s the way it is. All out
on the run, fellows!”</p>

<p>When the Linton center fielder had swung thrice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
at Morton’s delivery without connecting Joe arose
from the substitute’s bench and strode off toward
the track. He had no doubts as to the outcome of
the game, for with but three innings to play it was
unlikely that the visitors would overtake the home
team’s lead of six runs, and he was due for a half-hour’s
work with the shot. But he felt sorry about
Terry. Terry was a nice kid and he was fond of
him, and ever since he had known him, which meant
since last September, Terry had tried and failed at
half a dozen things. Terry had just failed of making
the second football eleven, had almost but not
quite finished fourth in the four-forty yards in the
Fall Handicap Meet, had been beaten out by Walt
Gordon for cover-point position on the second
hockey team, had been passed over in the Debating
Society election and now, just when, as Joe very
well knew, Terry was beginning to congratulate
himself on having made the school baseball team,
Fate was about to deal him another blow. It was
really mighty tough luck, Joe growled to himself;
and if Fos had been anyone but Fos he would have
suspected him of prejudice. But Terry Wendell’s
troubles were forgotten when Joe had thrown off
his wrap and had the twelve-pound shot cupped in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
his broad palm, and weren’t remembered again
until, just before six, he pushed open the door of 12
Munsing.</p>

<p>Terry was pretending to study, but Joe knew very
well from the discouraged look on his face that
Fos had spoken and that Terry’s thoughts were far
from the book before him. He looked up at Joe’s
entry, murmured “Hello!” in a rather forlorn voice
that tried hard to be cheerful and bent his head
again.</p>

<p>“How’d the game come out?” asked Joe, banging
the door with unnecessary violence.</p>

<p>“We won; twelve to eight.”</p>

<p>“Linton must have got a couple more runs over
after I left,” said Joe. “How did you get along?”</p>

<p>“Oh, pretty punk, thanks. I got one hit, rather
a scratch, and was forced out at third. I got as
far as third again and Whittier flied to the Linton
right fielder and left me there.”</p>

<p>“Hard luck! How about your fielding?”</p>

<p>“Three chances and got them.” There was
silence for a moment. Joe nursed a foot on the
window-seat and waited. At last: “I’m out of it,
Joe,” said Terry with a fine affectation of indifference.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
“Fosdick told me after the game that they’d
decided to get along without my valuable services.”</p>

<p>Joe pretended surprise. Terry cut short his expressions
of sympathy, however. “It doesn’t matter,”
he said. “I mean I ought to have known how
it would be. I didn’t, though. I thought I’d really
made good at something finally. I wrote home only
last Sunday that I’d got on the nine. Well, I can
sit back now, can’t I? There isn’t anything left to
try for!”</p>

<p>“Pshaw, that’s no way to talk, Terry. There’s
your track work, remember. You’re pretty sure to
get your chance with the quarter-milers.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to quit that. I know what’ll happen.
Either they’ll drop me the day before the Dual
Meet or I’ll trail in in fifth place.”</p>

<p>“Quit nothing!” said Joe disgustedly. “You’re
going to stick, kid, if I have to lug you out by
the feet and larrup you around the track!” Terry
smiled faintly at the idea.</p>

<p>“You won’t have to, Joe. I was only talking.
I’ll keep on with the Track Team as long as they’ll
have me. Maybe——” He hesitated a moment
and then went on doubtfully. “Maybe I can get
Cramer to try me in the half, Joe. I have an idea<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
I could run the half better than the four-forty.
Anyway, I’ll stick. And I’ll try my hardest.
There—there must be <em>something</em> I can do!”</p>

<p>Terry Wendell was fifteen, a nice-looking, well-built
boy, rather slender but by no means frail, with
frank brown eyes, somewhat unruly hair of the
same color and a healthy complexion. He had entered
Maple Park School the preceding Fall, making
the upper middle class. He was good at studies
and was seldom in difficulties with the instructors
in spite of the time he consumed in the pursuit of
athletic honors. Of course entering the third year
class had handicapped him somewhat and his circle
of friends and acquaintances was far smaller than
if he had joined the school as a junior, but he
hadn’t done so badly, after all, for Joe Tait had
kindly taken him in hand and become a sort of
social sponsor for him. What friends Terry had
were firm ones and, had he but known it, liked him
none the less for the plucky way in which, having
been turned down in one sport, he bobbed up undismayed
for another. But Terry, not knowing
that, suspected the fellows of secretly smiling at his
failures, and had become a little sensitive, a trifle
inclined to detect ridicule where none was meant.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
Which fact probably accounts for the falling-out
with Walt Gordon the next day.</p>

<p>It was Sunday, and as perfect a day as the Spring
had given. May was nearly over, the trees in the
campus and on the long slope of Maple Hill were
fully clothed in fresh green and the bluest of blue
skies stretched overhead. Maple Hill, which rises
back of the school, is crowned by a great granite
ledge, from which one commands a view of many
miles of smiling countryside. The Ledge is a
favorite spot with the students and its seamed and
crumbling surface is marked in many places with
evidences of fires and, I regret to say, too often
littered with such unlovely objects as empty pickle
bottles, cracker boxes and the like. On this
Sunday afternoon “Tolly” hailed the bottles with
joy and, having collected five of them, advanced to
the farther edge of the rock and hurled them gleefully
far down into the tops of the trees. Tolly’s
real name was Warren Tolliver, and he was only
fourteen, and for the latter reason his performance
with the pickle bottles was viewed leniently by the
other four boys. Tolly’s youthfulness gave him
privileges.</p>

<p>Ordinarily the party would have been a quartette;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
Joe, Terry, Hal Merrill and Tolly; but to-day
they had happened on Walt Gordon and Walt had
joined them. He was a heavily-built chap in appearance,
but when he was in track togs you saw
that the heaviness was mostly solid muscle and
sinew. He was Maple Park’s crack miler and, beside,
played a rather decent game at center field
on the nine. He was respected for his athletic
prowess, but beyond that was not very popular,
for he thought a bit too highly of Walt Gordon and
too little of anyone else. But none of his four companions
really disliked him or had resented his attaching
himself to their party. When he cared to,
Walt could be very good company.</p>

<p>Stretched on the southern slope of the ledge,
where sun and wind each had its way with them,
the five boys found little to say at first. The climb
had left them warm and a trifle out of breath. It
was the irrepressible Tolly who started the conversational
ball rolling. “Know something, fellows?”
he demanded. Joe lazily denied any knowledge
on any subject and begged enlightenment.
“Well,” continued Tolly, “when I get through college——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>“Ha!” grunted Hal. Tolly tossed a pebble at him
and went on.</p>

<p>“When I get through college I’m coming back
here and I’m going to build one of those aerial
railways from the roof of Main Hall to this place.
It’ll cost you fellows twenty-five cents apiece to get
up here. No, maybe I’ll make it twenty-five for the
round-trip.”</p>

<p>“I’ll walk before I pay a quarter,” said Walt.</p>

<p>“You won’t be allowed to, because I’ll buy up the
hill and put a barbed wire fence around it. You’ll
have to ride.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to run the thing, Tolly?”
asked Joe. “Pull it up yourself?”</p>

<p>“Electricity. There’ll be two cars. Wouldn’t it
be fine?”</p>

<p>“You’ll let your friends ride free, won’t you?”
Terry inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I shan’t have any then. It’ll cost too
much.”</p>

<p>“All that doesn’t cause me a flutter,” said Hal.
“By the time Tolly’s out of college I’ll be dead.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe it,” Joe chuckled. “It won’t
take him two weeks to get through college—if he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
once gets in. It’ll be a case of ‘Howdy do, Mr.
Tolliver. Goodby, Mr. Tolliver!’”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted Tolly. “That’s all you know
about it, Joey. I can get in any college I like,
and——”</p>

<p>“Yes, but suppose they found you?” said Hal.</p>

<p>“I’m getting letters every day from all the big
ones: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Cornell——”</p>

<p>“Vassar,” suggested Joe helpfully.</p>

<p>“That’s what comes of being a real ball-player,”
concluded Tolly. “Everyone wants you.”</p>

<p>A groan of derision arose. “A real ball-player!”
said Hal. “You poor fish, you never caught a ball
but once in your life, and then you couldn’t get
out of its way!” Hal rolled over a little so that he
could see Terry. “You never heard about that, did
you, Terry?” he asked. “It was last Spring. Tolly
was trying for the nine and the coach sort of let
him hang around and look after the bats and keep
the water bucket filled, you know. The only trouble
was that he was so small that fellows were always
falling over him, and finally Murdock, who was
captain then, decided to get rid of him. But Tolly
hid behind the bucket and Murdock couldn’t find
him, and one day we played Spencer Hall and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
fellow named Williams, the regular left fielder, was
sick, and another fellow got spiked or something
and there was only Tolly left. So Murdock called
him and Tolly crawled out from under a
glove——”</p>

<p>“Aw, dry up,” grumbled Tolly.</p>

<p>“And they put him out in center, just to fill up,
you know. Of course Murdock told him that if a
fly came toward him to run like the dickens and
not try to worry it. And sure enough one of the
Spencer Hall fellows lit on a good one and sent
it into left. Tolly was dreaming away out
there, or picking daisies or something: I forget:
and all of a sudden he heard a yell and here was
that awful ball sailing right down at him! It was
a horrible moment in Tolly’s young life. He tried
hard to run away, but the pesky ball just followed
him. If he ran back the ball went after him. If
he ran to the right the ball went that way too. It
was awful! Poor old Tolly nearly fainted. Center
fielder was coming hard for it, but it was a long
hit——”</p>

<p>“The longest ever made on the field!” interpolated
Tolly proudly.</p>

<p>“And he couldn’t reach it. Tolly saw that there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
was no use trying to escape, so finally he stood still,
resolved to sell his life dearly, and put up his hands
to ward off the ball. Well, sir, Terry, that ball went
right against Tolly’s hands and Tolly gave a cry
of fear and fell down unconscious!”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” demanded Tolly indignantly.
“Well, the ball stuck, didn’t it? And I wasn’t so
unconscious that I couldn’t jump up and peg to
shortstop, was I? <em>Huh!</em>”</p>

<p>“So after that,” concluded Hal, “as a sort of reward
for accidentally saving the game, they let him
sit on the bench and called him a substitute fielder.”</p>

<p>Terry joined in the laughter, and then, catching
Tolly’s eyes on him, stopped suddenly. There was
something of apology in Tolly’s look and Terry
understood. It was Tolly who had profited by his
failure. Tolly would play right field after this. He
was made certain of it the next moment, for Walt
Gordon remarked:</p>

<p>“Well, you’re all right now, Tolly. They can’t
keep a good man down, eh?”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” asked Hal, who was not a ball
player, but performed on the track, being one of the
school’s best sprinters and no mean hand at the
hurdles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>Walt shot a questioning glance at Terry. “Don’t
you know, Hal? Why, Terry has decided to quit
us,” answered Walt. “What’s next, Terry? The
Tennis Team?”</p>

<p>Terry flared instantly, quite as much to his own
surprise as to theirs, for he was not usually quick-tempered.
“You mind your own business, Walt,”
he snapped. “I’ll attend to mine.”</p>

<p>Walt flushed. “Is that so?” he sneered. “Well,
I’m just curious, that’s all. There’s only the Tennis
Club left, you know. Unless you go in for chess.”</p>

<p>“Cut it out, Walt,” said Joe. “Let him alone.”</p>

<p>“Then tell him to let me alone. I didn’t say
anything to make him jump down my throat.
Everyone here knows he’s had a whack at everything
there is and fallen down. If he doesn’t like
to hear that he knows what he can do. I’m ready
to——”</p>

<p>Terry leaped to his feet. “Then come on!” he
cried, his eyes blazing. “If you can do anything
besides talk, prove it, you—you big——”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Terry!” commanded Joe sternly.
“And sit down. There isn’t going to be any scrapping.
You mustn’t fly off the handle like that. And
you, Walt, shouldn’t say such things. There’s no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
disgrace in trying and failing as long as you don’t
grouch about it. Terry’s plucky to keep on trying,
I think.”</p>

<p>“Of course he is,” agreed Tolly warmly. “You
shut up, Walt.”</p>

<p>Walt shrugged disdainfully. “Oh, very well.
Four against one——”</p>

<p>“There’s one thing I haven’t fallen down at yet,”
interrupted Terry, still angry, “and that’s running,
and——”</p>

<p>“Also-running, you mean,” laughed Walt.
“You’re the finest little also-ran in the history of the
school, Wendell!”</p>

<p>“Am I? Let me tell you something, Gordon.
I’ll be running when you’ve quit. If I’m an ‘also-ran,’
you’re a quitter. You quit last Fall because
Hyde had twenty yards on you in the next to the
last lap. You thought no one——”</p>

<p>“That’s a lie! I turned my ankle on the
board——”</p>

<p>“Did you? Well, you walked well enough five
minutes later. Look here, I’ll bet you right now,
anything you like, that I’ll win more points than you
when we meet Lacon!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a chump, Terry,” begged Hal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, piffle!” sneered Walt. “You won’t even
be on the track!”</p>

<p>“That’s my lookout. Will you bet?”</p>

<p>“No, he won’t,” said Joe. “And that’ll be about
all from both of you. Now dry up. If I hear any
more from either of you I’ll chuck you over the
ledge. Is this what you chaps call a peaceful Sunday
afternoon?”</p>

<p>“All right, I will dry up,” replied Terry. “But
he heard me. And I mean what I said. And when
the Dual Meet is over he will know it!”</p>

<p>The next afternoon Terry went across to the field
the moment he had finished his last recitation. Mr.
Cramer—Sam to the older boys, but “Coach” to
the others—was busy with a bunch of hurdlers,
amongst whom was Hal, when Terry arrived, and
he had to wait several minutes before he was able
to claim the trainer’s attention. Down at the farther
end of the oval Joe and a half-dozen others
were moving about the pits, while various white-clad
forms jogged or sprinted around the track.
The Dual Meet with Lacon Academy, Maple Park’s
dearest foe, was only a little more than a fortnight
distant and a late Spring had held back the team’s
development discouragingly. This Monday afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
Coach Cramer was in a hustling mood, and
there was a hint of impatience in his voice when
he called the hurdlers back for the third start.</p>

<p>“Stop trying to beat the pistol!” he barked. “The
next fellow who does it will stay out. Now then,
on your mark! <em>Set!</em>”</p>

<p><em>Bang</em> went the pistol and six slim, lithe figures
hurled themselves forward and went darting down
the lanes. Hal began to gain at the fourth hurdle—they
were doing the 220-yards sticks—and at the
finish was running strong. Terry noticed that he
held back between the last barrier and the string
and let Porter breeze past him into first place.
While the next squad were taking their places Terry
addressed the trainer.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cramer, don’t you think I might try the
half, sir?” he asked. “I’ve sort of got a hunch I
can do better at a longer distance than the four-forty.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Wendell. What’s that? The half? We
don’t need you in the half, my boy. You stick to
the quarter. I guess that’s your distance, if you
have any. How are you feeling to-day?”</p>

<p>“Fine, sir.”</p>

<p>“All right. Jog a couple of laps and then try<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
some starts. I’m going to give you quarter-milers
a trial at four.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir: and about that half, Mr. Cramer.
There wouldn’t be any harm in my just trying it,
would there? I mean later on, after the trial.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.” The coach and trainer turned
and looked Terry over speculatively. “No, I guess
not, if it’s going to please you. But take it easy.
Three minutes is fast enough. I’ll tell you now,
though, that it don’t do you any good, for we’ve
got so many half-milers that we can’t use them all.”</p>

<p>Terry managed to scrape past in fourth place in
the four-forty trial, beating out Connover and Dale,
and felt rather proud until Mr. Cramer dryly announced
the winner’s time to have been 54⅗
seconds, which was more than a second slower than
it should have been. He wrapped himself in his
gaudy green-and-red dressing gown and went over
to watch the jumpers for awhile, and finally, when
the field was nearly empty and Pete, the grounds-keeper,
was removing the standards, he walked
over to the start of the distances, wriggled out of
his gown, limbered his legs a minute and then went
off, hugging the inside rim. He had to guess at
his speed. He knew from watching others that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
eight-eighty was a different race from the quarter
and all the way round the first lap he held himself
back so that he might have some reserve for the
finish. But when he had put the turn behind him
and entered the backstretch on the second lap his
lungs were protesting and his legs had lost their
spring. It was a pretty wobbly runner who at last
crossed the finish, and who was glad to sit down
for a moment, his gown flung around his shoulders.
He was thankful that none of the few fellows remaining
had apparently noticed his journey along
the homestretch. He went back to the gymnasium
rather discouraged, but a shower-bath perked him
up considerably, and after he had talked with Joe
he felt still better. For Joe pointed out that after
having run in a quarter-mile trial he had scarcely
been in ideal condition to do himself justice in the
eight-eighty. Joe wasn’t especially sympathetic toward
Terry’s ambition to add the half-mile to his
repertoire, but he was too good-natured to throw
cold water on it.</p>

<p>The next afternoon Terry divided his time—and,
since he was no longer essential to the nine, he had
plenty of it—between the routine prescribed by the
coach and his self-training for the half. Perhaps had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
Terry been viewed by Mr. Cramer a trifle more seriously
he would not have been allowed to risk overtraining,
but the coach wasn’t especially impressed
with the boy’s efforts. Perhaps next year Terry
might find himself, and it was in that hope that
the coach gave him such encouragement as he did.
Of course Terry didn’t go the full half-mile on
Tuesday, nor yet on Wednesday. He knew better
than to do that. What he did do was follow in a
general way the instructions given to the half-milers.
He tried short sprints of thirty and forty
yards at top-speed, jogged a mile each day and at
last, on Thursday, cut in with the half-milers and
ran the three-quarters with them—or, rather, behind
them—at a fairly good clip. He was trying hard
to learn this new distance, and it wasn’t easy. He
knew fairly well how hard he could go for the four-forty
without running himself out, but twice around
the track, with eight corners to reckon instead of
four, was a vastly different proposition.</p>

<p>And yet, when Saturday came and he gave up
seeing the Prentiss game for the sake of running,
he felt sure enough of himself to ask permission
to enter the trial with the regular half-milers. Mr.
Cramer gave rather impatient permission and Terry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
took his place in the second row and tried to remain
unconscious of the looks of surprise or amusement
with which his companions viewed him. Terry
Wendell was in a fair way to become rather a joke,
it seemed. But Terry didn’t do so badly in the
trial, after all, for out of the field of twelve he
finished seventh. It was a poor seventh, to be sure,
and he never learned his time, but he thought that
Mr. Cramer observed him a bit more tolerantly
afterwards, even if he had nothing to say to him.
That race taught Terry one thing, which was that
the half-mile was not so long as he had reckoned
it. He had run too slow in the first lap. Another
time, he told himself, he would know better than to
let the others get away from him like that. He had
finished the race with a lot of reserve which, had
he called on it before, might have put him in fourth
place at least.</p>

<p>Relations between him and Walt Gordon were
strained. Walt, secure in the knowledge of his
supremacy in the mile run, was not worried by
Terry’s new activity. Walt was pretty sure of
handing over five points to his school in the Dual,
for Lacon was known to be weak in the mile, and
was equally sure that if Terry managed to secure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
the one point that went with fourth place he would
be doing more than anyone expected of him. But
Terry’s accusation to the effect that Walt had quit
in the Fall Meet held just enough truth to be unpleasant
to the latter youth, and his feelings in consequence
were not very cordial toward Terry. As
to the incident mentioned, why, it didn’t amount to
much in Walt’s judgment, but, just the same, he
preferred that fellows shouldn’t suspect it. He <em>had</em>
turned his ankle in the third lap, just as he had said,
but there was no denying that had Hyde not had a
fifteen or twenty yard lead on him he would have
finished the race without untold agony. As it was,
it wasn’t worth while. Everyone knew that he
was better than Hyde. And Walt hated to be
beaten! He and Terry didn’t speak to each other
just now: didn’t even see each other if they could
help it: but Terry heard from Tolly that Walt was
making amusing remarks about the new half-miler:
and it needed only that to make Terry buckle down
to track work harder than ever.</p>

<p>Tolly had covered himself with glory in the Prentiss
game, getting two hits off the visiting pitcher,
which was one more than anyone else had secured
and two more than most. And he had fielded well,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
besides. The fact that Prentiss had won the contest
in a last fatal inning didn’t detract from
Tolly’s glory. Terry, though still hurt over being
dropped, was glad that Tolly had succeeded to his
position, and said so, and Tolly showed vast relief.
“I was afraid you’d be sore at me,” he explained.
“I didn’t want you to think that I was trying to
get you out, Terry. Anyway, you’d have done just
as well as I did if you’d been in my place.” Terry
wanted to think that, too, but he couldn’t quite
do it.</p>

<p>On Monday Mr. Cramer surprised him by saying:
“I guess you’d better cut out your sprints to-day,
Wendell. You didn’t do so badly in the half
Saturday and I’ve half a mind to let you see what
you can do. How did you come through?”</p>

<p>“Fresh as a daisy, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, go easy this afternoon. Jog a mile and
do a short sprint at the finish. If I were you I’d
try for a shorter stride, my boy. It looks to me
as if you were straining a bit. There’s nothing in
a long stride if it doesn’t come natural.”</p>

<p>The next day, when work was over, the coach
spoke again. “I’ll put you down for the half, Wendell,”
he said. “There’s no doubt about your being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
a better middle-distance runner than a sprinter.
And I’m not sure that you’ve found your right line
yet. Next Fall, if I were you, I’d have a try at the
mile. Maybe you can run them both. There’ll be
another trial about Friday, and if you show up well
I’ll enter you for the Dual.”</p>

<p>Terry went back to Munsing Hall with his heart
beating high. He found Hal Merrill and Phil Hyde
there with Joe. Hyde was an upper middler, a
slim, dark-complexioned fellow with quiet manners.
He and Hal roomed together over in Warren.
“Here’s another one,” said Hal as Terry entered.
“Want to go on a hike Sunday, Terry?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. Where?”</p>

<p>“Bald Mountain. We’re going to take grub
along and make a fire. Phil’s getting too fat and
wants to reduce.”</p>

<p>“That’s a bully way of doing it,” Terry laughed,
viewing Hyde’s lean form. “Bald Mountain’s a
good five miles.”</p>

<p>“And the last mile all uphill,” added Joe grimly.
“I’m game, though. Who else is going?”</p>

<p>“Guy Fosdick, I guess, and Tolly. We don’t want
too many. Take that alcohol stove of yours, Joe, will
you? We’ll make some coffee on it. I don’t mind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
frying steak on an open fire, but coffee’s something
else again.”</p>

<p>Presently Phil Hyde said to Terry: “I hear
you’ve blossomed out as a half-miler, Wendell.”
Terry said “Yes” suspiciously and waited for the
inevitable joke. But Phil only remarked that he
hoped Terry would beat out some of those “one-lungers.”</p>

<p>“‘One-lungers’ is good,” approved Hal laughingly.
“Some of those fellows, like Lambert and
Tilling, have about as much license to be running
in the half-mile as I’d have to—to throw the
hammer!”</p>

<p>“Our chance of winning the Dual is about as big
as a piece of cheese,” growled Joe. “I was figuring
this morning and all I can see with a telescope is
forty-four points. We can count on first and second
in the hundred-yards and in the mile, but I
don’t see another first in sight; unless it’s in the
high hurdles.”</p>

<p>“Better not count on that either,” said Hal.
“Munroe can beat me out two times out of three.
But what about your own stunt? Mean to say you
aren’t going to get a first in the shot-put.”</p>

<p>“I’m not counting on it,” replied Joe. “Cobb, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
Lacon, has been doing thirty-seven feet right along
in practice, I hear.”</p>

<p>Hal whistled expressively, but Phil advised them
not to believe all they heard. “And don’t be too
sure of second place in the mile, either, Joe. Walt’s
been doing a lot of talking about how poor our
hated rival is, but I’ve a hunch that some of their
milers will give us a good tussle. Of course, Walt’s
sure of his five points, but I may be lucky to get
one instead of three. You can’t tell. Besides,
they’ll enter four or five men to our three, and that
gives them the edge of the start. Still, I guess
we’ve got a show for the meet, Joe. If you can see
forty-four points to-day we can hustle around a
week from Thursday and round up a few more.
Never say die, old dear!”</p>

<p>From Tuesday until Friday Terry lived in a condition
of alternate hope and despair. There were
times when he felt that he was bound to fail in the
trial and times when he believed that he could make
good. He was still working at the quarter, but
there was no disguising the fact that at least three
of his team-mates had made better progress in their
training than he had, and he felt very certain that
his only chance of representing Maple Park the following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
Thursday lay in qualifying with the half-milers.</p>

<p>Mr. Cramer sent them away at a little after four
that afternoon, a round dozen in all, of whom no
more than six could expect to be chosen for competition
against Lacon. After it was over, just two
minutes and eleven seconds later, Terry was surprised
to think how easy it had been. He had not
made the mistake this time of holding back at the
start, but had pushed to third place at once and
held it to the last corner of the first lap. Then
Howland set him back and he passed the line running
fourth. Stevens, setting the pace, yielded as
they turned into the backstretch and Terry was
again in third place. A red-haired senior named
Wallace gave him a hard race along the straight,
but Terry beat him to the turn by a stride and
hugged the rim as he came around into the homestretch.
By that time the field was strung out halfway
around and two of the competitors had fallen
out. Howland had taken the lead and was having
it nip-and-tuck with Green. Terry followed a good
half-dozen yards behind. Stevens put a scare into
him just short of the finish, but Terry had something
left and beat him across by a few strides. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
next morning Maple Park’s entries for the Dual
Meet were mailed to her rival and the name of
Terry Wendell was amongst them.</p>

<p>There was no work for the track and field men
on Saturday, and so Terry and Joe sat together and
saw the Lacon Academy Baseball Team go down to
defeat by the score of 6 to 5 in a ten-inning contest
filled with thrills. Starting out as a pitchers’ battle,
it developed toward the end into a fielding competition.
Both sides took to hitting, but hardly a
hit got beyond the infield unless it was a high and
safe fly, and victory depended on perfect defense.
It was, properly enough, Captain Fosdick who broke
the tie in the tenth. With one gone and a man on
first, Fos laid down a bunt that should have been
converted into an easy out. But Lacon’s taut
nerves jangled badly and the third baseman, trying
for speed, pegged wide of first. The runner on
first kept on to third and then, with the ball speeding
across to that bag, took a long and desperate
chance. He put his head down and scuttled for the
plate. Had the third baseman not been rattled by
his previous misplay, the runner’s chance would
have been poor indeed, but the Lacon player, surprised,
doubtful, hesitated an instant too long and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
then had to throw hurriedly. If the ball had
reached the catcher below his waist he might have
sent the game into the eleventh inning, but he had
to reach for it, and before he could sweep it down
on the runner that youth had hooked a foot across
the rubber and the baseball championship of the
year was Maple Park’s.</p>

<p>That victory cheered the school hugely and was
accepted as a good augury for the Meet. And it
was reflected in the spirits of the five boys who
met in 12 Munsing at two the next day and, a few
minutes later clattered downstairs and started off
on their picnic. Fos had failed them at the last
moment, and so the party was composed of Joe,
Terry, Hal, Tolly and Phil Hyde. Each one carried
his portion of the provender and cooking apparatus,
Hal looking picturesque with a skillet flapping
over his hip. Tolly produced a chorus of contemptuous
protest when he wheeled his bicycle from
concealment alongside the entrance of Munsing and
nonchalantly mounted it.</p>

<p>“This is a hike, you lazy beggar!” said Joe. “Get
off that thing!”</p>

<p>But Tolly explained. He was a good explainer.
“That’s all right for you fellows, but I’m not up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
to ten miles to-day. Think of what I went through
yesterday, Joe! Winning a game like that one takes
it out of you!”</p>

<p>“You didn’t even get a hit!” jeered Hal.</p>

<p>“Hits aren’t everything,” answered Tolly loftily.
“Someone has to do the brain work. Besides, five
miles <em>is</em> a bit of a jaunt when the last two are uphill,
and we can take turns on the wheel. And we can
strap a lot of things on it, too, and not have to
lug ’em.”</p>

<p>That sounded more reasonable and Tolly won.
Later they were thankful that he had, for Fate
brought about circumstances that made that bicycle
a fortunate possession. They didn’t try for a record
and consumed nearly three hours in reaching the
top of Bald Mountain. The roads were good until
they reached the little village of Pearson, at the
foot of the mountain, but from there they had rough
going. The wagon road which wound to the summit
by devious ways was rutted and rock-strewn
and the last half of it was pretty steep. But they
took it easy and were on top before five and at half-past
had their fire going in the stone fire-place that
some thoughtful persons had built several years
before. They still had three hours of daylight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
before them, a cooling breeze swept past them from
the southwest and they were comfortably weary and
as hungry as five bear cubs. Hal cooked and Terry
officiated at the coffee pot. After all they had to
make coffee over the fire, for, although Joe had
faithfully brought along his alcohol heater, he had
made the lamentable mistake of forgetting the alcohol!
But the coffee tasted all right, even if it was
muddy. And the steak—well, when Tolly got his
first taste of that steak he just turned his eyes
Heavenward and said “<em>Oh boy!</em>” in awed rapture.
There were baked potatoes, too, a bit solid in the
middle and somewhat charred outside but fine elsewhere,
and toast—if you could wait for it—and
bananas and cakes of chocolate. Nothing marred
the beatific success of the jaunt up to the time that
the fog arrived. It was Joe who drew the attention
of the others to the fact that the wide-flung landscape
below them was no longer visible. As a fog
on Bald Mountain is a damp and chilly affair, and
as it is no particular aid to finding one’s way down
a road that twists like a grapevine, they decided to
make an early start.</p>

<p>They still had the sinking sun in their eyes when
they began the descent, but when they had dropped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
a few hundred feet the gray mist was about them
and, as the sun took that moment to disappear
behind the mountain, they found that they had to
proceed slowly and cautiously. It would be no
difficult task to walk off the winding road and so
get down faster and more painfully than desired.
Tolly, who had eaten well but not wisely, had his
wheel as well as himself to navigate and was frequently
heard regretting the fact that he had yielded
to the blandishments of the others and fetched it
along! More than once the party came to a pause
while Joe, leading, gingerly sought the direction of
the erratic wagon road. The fog began to depress
them and affected even Tolly’s good-nature. Twilight
deepened the gloom and called for an increase
of caution, and Joe had just finished an admonition
to keep well toward the mountain side of the road
when the accident happened.</p>

<p>There was a sharp exclamation of dismay and
then a crashing of the bushes and low, stunted trees
and silence. “What’s that?” called Joe startledly.
“Anyone hurt?”</p>

<p>“Someone went over!” cried Hal. “Terry, I
think!”</p>

<p>“I’m here! Tolly?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>“Here! I think it was Phil. O Phil!” There
was no answer. They called again, creeping cautiously
to the unguarded edge of the road. “I heard
someone stumble,” gasped Hal, “and then something
that sounded like ‘<em>Gee!</em>’ and then——”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to go down there,” said Joe. “I wish
we had a flashlight. Who’s got matches?”</p>

<p>They found him presently, thirty feet below,
lodged against a small boulder that projected from
the steep face of the cliff. They could get no reply
to their anxious appeals, and when, by the light of
many matches that burned dimly in the heavy mist,
they found the back of his head wet with blood the
explanation confronted them. Tolly went quite to
pieces and babbled incoherently, but the others, to
their credit, kept their heads in spite of their horror
and fear. It was a hard task to get him back to
the road, but they did it at last, and then an attempt
was made to use the bicycle as an ambulance. But
two trials showed the impossibility of that, for the
road was never meant for bicycle traffic. To search
for poles to make a litter of was out of the question,
for the trees were small, wind-twisted things
and the gloom was too deep for searching further.
In the end it was Terry’s plan that was adopted.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
The others were to carry Phil between them as best
they might and he would take the bicycle and get
to Pearson as fast as he could and bring the doctor
back.</p>

<p>Terry is not likely to forget that ride down the
side of Bald Mountain even if he lives far beyond
the allotted age of man. Once started there was no
actual stopping, since he discovered to his dismay
that Tolly’s wheel had no coaster brake. All he
could do was hold back to the best of his ability, try
to keep away from the outer edge of the road and
trust to luck. Fortunately the fog thinned almost
at once and the road was dimly visible ahead. But
rocks and ruts were not visible, at least not in time
for avoidance, and more than a dozen times Terry’s
heart jumped into his throat as he felt the wheel
bound aside perilously near the edge. After a minute
or two the descent became more gradual and
the roadbed better and he threw discretion to the
winds and went tearing, bounding down, clinging
to handlebars and saddle on a mad coast. In spite
of his danger, or perhaps because of it, there was
an exhilaration that made him forget for a moment
or two the purpose of his errand. But then a
vision of Phil’s white face under the dim light of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
flickering matches returned to him and he shuddered
and would have gone faster yet had that been
possible. Then the mountain road straightened out,
the fog was gone, the wind ceased roaring past his
ears and making his eyes water and lights shone
faintly through the late twilight ahead. Short of
the village he found his pedals again and, save that
his cap had left him far back, presented a fairly
reputable appearance as he brought up before the
gate of the little white house on which he had noted
in the afternoon a doctor’s sign. Fortunately the
physician, a middle-aged and rather stodgy man,
was at home, and fortunately too his small automobile
was standing in the lane beside the house, its
little engine chugging merrily, and in less than four
minutes Terry had leaned Tolly’s bicycle against
the white picket fence and was rattling and jouncing
away into the early darkness with Doctor
Strang. Presently the little car was panting against
the increasing grade but still going well, dodging
stones and obstacles, and before it was forced to
acknowledge defeat Joe, Hal and Tolly came into
sight through the darkness with Phil on their
shoulders.</p>

<p>Then, with Phil on the back seat of the car and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
the boys hanging on wherever they could, the automobile
was somehow turned and sent racing down
the road again. Terry helped carry the still unconscious
boy into the doctor’s office and then stood by
while an examination was made. There was one
long sigh of relief from all when the verdict was
given. Phil had had a pretty hard blow on the base
of the brain, producing unconsciousness, explained
Doctor Strang, but there appeared to be no fracture
of the skull, and it was likely that a few days in
bed would bring him around where he could try
more fool stunts like walking off the side of a
mountain! After that the doctor got efficiently
busy and ten minutes later Phil, conscious again,
but pretty well bruised and not inclined to talk, was
back in the car and they set off for Maple Park. It
was nearly nine when they reached school and long
after midnight before sleep came to either Terry
or Joe.</p>

<p>Phil was a sick looking boy when Terry came in
to see him for a minute the next afternoon in the
infirmary, but he spoke hopefully of being all right
by Thursday and Terry went off to the field presently
with no premonition of what awaited him
there. Lacon’s list of entries had arrived and Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
Cramer and Steve Cooper, the latter captain of the
Track Team and Maple Park’s all-around athlete,
had looked it over and gone into executive session.
Lacon had six nominees for the mile run against
Maple Park’s three. Of course she might not start
them all when the time came, but if she did Maple
Park was due for a hard time. Six against three,
with all the possibilities of pace-making, pocketing
and general team-work, was too great an odds, and
coach and captain did some tall thinking. If Hyde
was able to run they might chance it, but if he
wasn’t they would have only Gordon and Pillon;
two entries against six!</p>

<p>“I don’t like it,” said Mr. Cramer. “It doesn’t
look good, Cap. Whether Hyde enters or doesn’t
it’s safe to say that he won’t be much use to us.
I’m for filling up with two or three men to make
it look like a race, anyway. We can count on Gordon
copping first or second place, but we need more
points than that. That Lacon bunch can kill off
Pillon easily. Look here, let’s start a couple of
half-milers. They can’t do any harm and they may
worry Lacon a bit. If Howland makes the pace
half-way through it may upset Lacon’s calculations
and let us edge in for third place. Howland and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
Green and—I wonder about young Wendell, Cap.
The boy’s got a lot of grit and he will try anything
you can show him. And I’m not so sure he isn’t
meant for a miler, anyway. At least he might give
those red-and-gray fellows a tussle. Sound fair?”</p>

<p>Cooper thought it did, and that’s why, when the
day’s workouts were over three surprised half-milers
were trying to get used to the knowledge
that just three days later they were to “kill themselves”
in two laps of a mile run. Neither Howland
nor Green showed much enthusiasm at the prospect.
There would be perhaps thirty minutes between the
races, but Howland didn’t think that he would have
much appetite for the mile after running the half,
no matter how much rest he got between whiles.
And Green spoke to much the same effect. Of the
three only Terry was pleased. Terry was more
than pleased. He was supremely delighted. He
didn’t imagine for a moment that he would secure
first place, or second, or third, but he had a sort
of sneaking idea that fourth place might not be
beyond the possibilities, and when he recalled that
rash boast to Walt Gordon he realized that one
point might save him from utter disgrace. He had
often wondered why on earth he had ever issued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
such a crazy challenge as that! He had as much
chance of winning more points than Walt as—as he
had of flying!</p>

<p>There was easy work on Tuesday and none at
all on Wednesday, save that certain of the team
were sent on a walk into the country in the afternoon.
Terry was among them. So was Walt Gordon,
still haughty and contemptuous. Hyde was
not. It was known now that Phil had been dropped.
He was still in bed and still plastered and bandaged.
Maple Park wasn’t thinking any too well of her
chances of winning the Meet just then. Terry was
no longer down for the four-forty. In something
under three weeks he had developed from a quarter-miler
into a distance runner, which was, to use
Tolly’s phrase, “going some!” As the day of the
Meet drew near Terry began to experience a mild
form of stage-fright, and there were moments when
he almost, if not quite, wished that he had been less
ambitious and had only the four-forty to win or
fail in.</p>

<p>Thursday dawned with a drizzling rain. Before
noon the sun came out hotly, but the track was
sodden and slow and the jumping-pits little better
than mud-holes. Lacon arrived, colorful and noisy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
at twelve and by two o’clock the athletic field was a
busy scene. The small grand-stand was crowded and
spectators to the number of nearly a thousand lined
the rope outside the track. A tent which flew the
cardinal-and-gray of Lacon Academy had been set
up as a dressing place for the visitors and about it
lolled or strolled a fine-looking band of invaders.
The trials in the 100-yards dash opened the event,
while pole-vaulters and jumpers began their leisurely
competitions.</p>

<p>Maple Park showed up badly in the first events.
Hal Merrill won her only first in the sprints and
got a second place in the high hurdles. In the low
hurdles he failed to qualify, getting a poor start
and not being able to make it up. The quarter-mile
went to Lacon and she took eight of the eleven
points. In the field events, however, the home team
was showing up unexpectedly well and, when the
half-mile was called, the adversaries were running
close as to scores. That half-mile proved to be a
pretty run. In spite of rumor, Lacon was not so
strong as feared, and Howland finished a good eight
yards ahead of the next runner, a Lacon youth.
Terry got third place, to everyone’s surprise, beating
out a red-and-gray boy in the final twenty yards.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
Terry got more applause from his schoolmates than
Howland, I think, and walked back to the gymnasium
breathless but delighted. At last, he told
himself, he had really succeeded in something, and
even if winning third place and thereby adding two
points to Maple Park’s score wasn’t anything to
gloat over it was highly satisfactory to him!</p>

<p>With all events save the mile run, the hammer
throw and the pole vault decided it was still anyone’s
victory. Maple Park had 51 points and Lacon
48. Then, while the milers were limbering up in
front of the grand-stand, word came of the hammer-throw
and Lacon had taken six of the eleven points
and was now but two points behind. She had already
secured a first in the pole-vault and it was a
question what of the remaining places she would
capture. It very suddenly dawned on the spectators
that the Meet hinged on the last event and that the
victory would likely go to the team winning the
majority of points in the mile run!</p>

<p>Perhaps it was as well for Terry’s peace of mind
that he didn’t know that, for he was feeling rather
out of his element and extremely doubtful as to the
part he was to play. His instructions had been to
get up with Howland and Green and force the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
running as long as he could, taking the lead from
Howland, in case that runner secured it, and making
the pace a hot one to at least the end of the second
lap. But they had placed him in the second row
of starters and well toward the outer edge of the
track and he foresaw difficulties in making his way
to the front. Gordon was almost directly ahead and
Pillon was second man from the pole in the first
rank, with Howland rubbing elbows with him. Then
the word came to get set and an instant later they
were off, crowding in toward the board, jostling and
scurrying. But that didn’t last long. In a moment
or two all had found their places, a long-legged
Lacon runner named Shores setting the pace. At
the turn Pillon went past Shores and Howland
passed Pillon. Terry was in fifth place, with Green
just ahead. Walt Gordon was seventh man and
Mullins, the Lacon hope, was ninth. Once around
the turn Howland caused a ripple of surprise by
drawing ahead at a killing pace. Shores accepted
the challenge and the leaders generally moved faster,
but neither Gordon nor Mullins altered their speed
a mite. Terry moved into fourth place and the
field began to string out. Howland kept the lead
to the end of the lap and then weakened, and Terry,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
remembering instructions, strove to get to the front.
But Green was at his toes and a Lacon runner had
him effectually pocketed as they went into the turn.
Consequently it was Green who became pace-maker,
and a hard pace he set. One by one the tail-enders
fell farther and farther away and the contestants
formed into two groups. At the half distance the
order was Green, Shores, Pillon, Terry, an unknown
Lacon runner, Gordon and Mullins. Well back
trailed Howland and three Lacon men.</p>

<p>Green was soon finished as a pace-maker and in
the back-stretch Shores was again in front. As
Green dropped back to Terry he gasped: “Get up
there, Wendell!” And Terry tried, but the Lacon
unknown moved even and held him at every attempt,
and then came the turn and Terry gave it up. The
race was telling on him now and his legs were getting
heavy and his lungs hot. Into the homestretch
they went, the crowd shouting wildly. As they sped
past the mark the brazen gong clanged, announcing
the beginning of the last lap, and at that instant
Mullins dug his spikes and edged himself forward.
Past his team-mate he went, past Terry, past Pillon,
and took his place close behind Shores. From behind
him Terry heard the Lacon supporters shout<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
their triumph. He wondered where Walt was.
Every instant he expected to see the blue-and-white
runner edge past him. But they made the turn and
straightened out and still Gordon held back. Terry
grew frightened then. Shores and Mullins were
gaining. Pillon came back steadily as Terry dug
harder and sought to overtake the leaders. The
unknown Lacon man—his name later turned out to
have been Geary, but at the time Terry had to hate
him without being able to put a name to him—crept
up and past. Terry’s fleeting glimpse of him showed
him a runner nearly “all in” but making a desperate
effort. Terry took courage and set his pace by the
unknown’s. And just then the sound from across
the oval took on a new note and something appeared
at Terry’s shoulder and slowly moved into sight and
Terry, to his great relief, saw that the something
was Walt Gordon.</p>

<p>It was only when Walt had put a half-dozen yards
between them and leaned to the turn that Terry
realized with sudden alarm that Walt was in little
better condition than the unknown who, just in front
of Terry, was wavering badly, his head sagging.
Shores yielded the lead to Mullins half-way around
the turn and an instant later Terry passed the unknown.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
He was running now with only a firm
determination to finish. It would have been the
greatest joy in life to have staggered aside and
dropped full-length on the blurred expanse of sod
at his feet. He wasn’t even thinking of points or
places. He only wanted to finish what he had
started, and he prayed silently and incoherently to
be allowed to keep his feet past that distant white
mark.</p>

<p>Down at the finish were straining eyes and taut
nerves, for the pole-vault was over and Lacon had
won first place and fourth and the score now stood
61 to 60 in favor of Maple Park. As the runners
made the turn Maple Park’s supporters read defeat.
Showing the pace, but still looking strong, came
Mullins with a good five yard lead over Gordon,
who was a scant yard ahead of Shores. Four or
five paces behind them was Pillon, about ready to
quit, and Terry, scarcely less willing. The unknown
had disappeared. If Gordon had looked better
Maple Park would have found reason to hope, but
he was already slipping. For once his well-known
ability to sprint at the finish was lacking. Terry,
looking across the last corner, saw Walt’s head fall
back. Walt recovered the next instant, but Terry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
understood. Pillon, too, was giving up. There
was nothing to it now but Lacon, and maybe the
Meet would go to the Cardinal-and-White! Terry’s
distorted face writhed with a scowl. If only he
had somehow kept himself fresher! If only he could
cut down that distance! They were in the homestretch
now and the finish was in sight. There
wasn’t time, even if he had the strength and lungs.</p>

<p>Pillon was no longer in sight to Terry now: only
Shores, wobbling on his long, spindly legs, Walt,
losing at every stride, and Mullins, ready to drop
but still fighting. Still fighting! Why, two could
play at that game! After all, thought Terry, he
was still there and his legs were still working under
him and his breath was still coming! Perhaps if
he tried desperately—— There might be time——.</p>

<p>Somehow he reached Shores, ran even with him
for an instant and passed him. Then Walt came
back to him, slowly but surely. He was running
in a dream now, a dream filled with a great noise
that seemed to come from very far away, a dream
that was a nightmare of leaden limbs and aching
lungs and tired body. He felt no triumph when he
pulled up to Walt, no exultation when he went past
him. He hardly knew that he had done so. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
wavering gaze was fixed on the one last form between
him and the nearing goal. He knew now
that he could never overtake it, but he kept on,
doggedly, fighting against exhaustion at every
stride. The great noise was louder in his ears but
meant nothing to him. A little distance away down
that interminable gray path other forms were
stretched from rim to rim. When he got there he
would be through. That would be wonderful!</p>

<p>Something tried to get in his way and he weakly
put out a hand as though to push it aside, but some
saving sense, or it may have been utter weakness,
prevented, and he let it fall again. He scraped
slowly past the obstacle, slowly because the obstacle
appeared to be going his way and hung at his elbow
for what seemed long minutes, and staggered on.
Once his feet got sort of confused and he nearly
fell, but he saved himself. He had forgotten Mullins
now, everything save his desire to reach that
goal, to finish what he had attempted, to come
through! And suddenly he was struggling weakly
against arms that tried to hold him back, panting,
swaying.</p>

<p>“Let me alone!” he gasped. “Let me—finish!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>“You have finished, Terry!” said a voice that
was very far away. “You’ve won, you crazy kid!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So that’s how Terry “came through” and how
Maple Park School discovered a new miler. Also
how the Blue-and-White won the Dual Meet from
Lacon, for Walt Gordon staggered over in fourth
place, making the final figures 67 to 65. Walt was
never quite the same after that, for his self-esteem
had had a pretty severe blow, and as a result he
was much more likeable. He must have been, else
he and Terry would never have roomed together
the next year.</p>

<p class="cap">Daniel Webster Jones, Jr., had
solemnly pronounced anathema, malediction
and imprecation upon Talbot Cummings.
He had put his whole heart and soul into
it and concentrated until his head felt funny. That
had been yesterday afternoon, just after dinner,
and now, more than twenty-four hours later, there
was Cummings stalking untroubledly along the
sloppy walk in the direction of the library, for all
the world as if Jonesie’s passionate utterances had
been benedictions and blessings. Gee, it was enough
to make a fellow doubt the efficacy of condemnation!
Jonesie flattened his somewhat button-like nose
against the pane in order to watch his enemy’s
ascent of the library steps. It was February, and
such things as steps and walks were treacherous
surfaces of glaring ice under pools of water. But
Cummings never even faltered, and Jonesie’s radiant
vision of his enemy prostrate with a number of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
broken limbs and all sorts of mysterious internal
injuries, to say nothing of outward contusions,
lacerations and abrasions, faded into thin air. A
prey to keen disappointment, his painfully oblique
gaze unwavering, Jonesie watched Cummings disappear
and the big oak door closed behind him.</p>

<p>Disconsolately he sank back on the window-seat,
rearranged his feet on “Sparrow” Bowles’ treasured
crimson silk cushion and again took up his book.
But although it was one of Kingston’s corkingest
sea-yarns, to-day it failed to hold Jonesie’s attention,
and presently it was face-down on that young
gentleman’s stomach while his thoughts pursued the
hated Cummings.</p>

<p>Cummings, you must know, had dealt a frightful
blow at Jonesie’s dignity. Cummings might call
it a joke, but its victim viewed it rather as a
dastardly attempt to disgrace him. It had started
with a perfectly excusable confusion of words on
Jonesie’s part; and if blame lay anywhere save on
Cummings it lay on the English language, which
contained words that looked alike and meant
differently.</p>

<p>Cummings, who roomed next door, had dropped
in to borrow an eraser, and while Jonesie, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
didn’t possess such a thing, was obligingly rummaging
through the cherished treasures of the absent
room-mate, Cummings’s reptilian eye had fallen on
a composition on which his host had been engaged
and which he had left on the table. Jonesie had
next heard a choking sound from the visitor and
had then witnessed his hurried departure, composition
in hand. Surprised, Jonesie had made outcry.
Then, suspicious, nay, chilled with dire apprehension,
he had given chase. But a moment of delay
had been his undoing. Below on the steps, where,
since it was a mild, thawing day, most of the inhabitants
of the dormitory were awaiting two
o’clock recitations, Cummings was already reading
aloud Jonesie’s epochal essay. “‘The ancient
Greeks,’” gurgled the traitorous Cummings, “‘had
a law forbidding a man to have more than one
wife.’” The reader’s voice broke, and Jonesie felt
that the tears were near his eyes. “‘This they
called <em>monotony</em>!’”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s wrong with it?” Jonesie had demanded
indignantly, striving to recover the paper.
And that, somehow, had increased the hilarity.
After that it was no use pretending that he had
discovered the mistake and was in the act of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
remedying it when Cummings had entered, no use
declaring, as a final desperate resort, that he had
purposely written it that way for fun. No one
believed him, no one even listened to him. Everyone
just laughed and laughed! For a minute Jonesie
had laughed, too, but he couldn’t keep it up. And
Cummings had waved the beastly paper out of his
reach and gurgled “‘This they called <em>monotony</em>’”
over and over, until Jonesie’s temper had fled and
he had kicked at Cummings’s shins and promised
to get even if it took him a million years! He had
said other things, too, which we won’t set down
here. And his tormentor had simply laughed and
choked and gurgled, and fought him off weakly
until, after awhile, a lucky grab had secured the
torn and wrinkled paper and Jonesie had fled back
to his room with it. Since then life had been a
horrible nightmare. His appearance in class rooms
had been the signal for idiotic grins and whisperings.
The demure smiles of the instructors showed
to what far distances the story had spread. Dining
hall was a torture chamber. “What was that law
the ancient Greeks had, Jonesie?” came to him
across the table, or “Guess I’ll try the apple sauce,
Billy, just to vary the <em>monotony</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>As I have said, the month was February, and
February at prep school corresponds to August in
the larger world. It’s the “silly season.” The
weather is too utterly “punk” for outdoor life. Detestable
thaws ruin sledding, skating and skiing. It
is still too early for Spring sports. Even mid-year
examinations are things of the past. Gray skies,
frequent rains, rotten ice, slush and mud: that’s
February. Studying wearies, reading palls, one
tires of everything. Room-mates who have lived
together in harmony for months throw hair-brushes
at each other and don’t speak for days at a time.
It is, in brief, a deadly dull, wearisome season, a
season in which the healthy boy welcomes anything
that promises to enliven his pallid existence, when
mischief finds its innings and when the weakest,
sorriest joke is hailed as roaring farce. At almost
any other time the jest on Jonesie would have been
laughed at good-naturedly and forgotten the next
day, but now it was a thing to be treasured and
acclaimed, nourished and perpetuated. Jonesie
knew that until baseball practice started, or—or one
of the school dormitories burned to the ground or
something equally interesting happened, he would
not hear the end of that putrid joke, and that if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
he had ever been uncertain of the correct meaning
of the word monotony that uncertainty was gone!</p>

<p>Disturbed by such knowledge, he stirred fretfully
and the book fell to the floor and lay there unheeded
while his thoughts engaged the subject of curses.
He had always understood that a curse if properly
formulated and delivered with earnestness and
solemnity invariably did the business. Only just
before Christmas Recess he had read a corking
story in which a quite ordinary curse had worked
wonders. He tried to find flaws in the maledictions
he had cast on Cummings but couldn’t. As he recalled
them they were perfectly regular, standard
curses, and he didn’t see why nothing had happened.
Of course, it might be that curses didn’t act right
off quick. Or it might be—and Jonesie gave a mental
jump at the thought—that it was necessary to
sort of help the curse along. Maybe it wasn’t
enough to just launch it: maybe you were supposed
to get behind and shove! In other words, if he
wanted ill-fortune in its most dreaded form to overwhelm
the obnoxious Cummings perhaps he had
better set his mind at work and sort of—sort of
think of something! Not a bad idea at all! Besides,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
hadn’t he most earnestly promised Cummings
to get even with him? He had. Therefor——.</p>

<p>Jonesie knit his troubled brow and half closed his
innocent gray-blue eyes and gave himself to the
problem. There was no use in attempting physical
punishment, for Cummings was seventeen and
Jonesie fourteen, and Cummings was tall and broad
and mighty and Jonesie was only what his age warranted.
No, what was needed, what was demanded
was a revenge that would hold Cummings up to
public ridicule as Jonesie had been held up and keep
him suspended until the world tired of laughing.
But just how——.</p>

<p>The door of the adjoining room banged shut and
Jonesie knew that Cummings had returned from
the library. A second <em>bang</em> proclaimed books
deposited on the table. He hoped Cummings had
failed to get what he wanted. One usually did at
the school library. He heard his hated neighbor
draw his chair to the window and heard it creak
under its load. If only, thought Jonesie, it would
give way instead of always threatening to! Eying
the door between the rooms that hid the enemy
from sight, Jonesie contemplated a fresh curse;
something with more “pep” than yesterday’s; less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
academic and more in the vernacular. But that
would necessitate arising, and he was very comfortable,
and he decided to give the original curse
another twenty-four hours to deliver the goods;
meanwhile, of course, aiding and abetting said curse
to the best of his ability so soon as his cogitations
should suggest——.</p>

<p>The cogitations ceased and Jonesie, his gaze still
on the communicating door, slid noiselessly from
the window-seat and tiptoed across the room until
he stood in front of it. Then, thrusting hands into
pockets to aid thought, he began a slow, close and
minute study of it. It was quite an ordinary door,
placed there when the dormitory was built in order,
presumably, that the two rooms might be thrown
together and used as study and sleeping apartment.
But Randall’s didn’t believe in too great luxury,
and you drew only one room and, if economical,
shared it with another fellow. Talbot Cummings
didn’t share his, which to Jonesie was most satisfactory.
Jonesie whistled under his breath as his
eager eyes became acquainted with every niche and
angle and knot and bit of hardware before him.
Of course the door was locked, and the key was
doubtless in safe keeping at the office, but besides<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
being locked it was secured by a bolt on each side;
and some secretive former occupant of Jonesie’s
room had plugged up the keyhole with red sealing-wax.
When it did open it swung into the adjoining
room, and, as the hinges were on the inward side
of the door, Jonesie was denied contemplation of
them. He was also denied contemplation of the
knob for the excellent reason that it was not there.
He recalled having detached it but couldn’t remember
for what purpose. Not that it mattered, however,
for what is a knob between enemies?</p>

<p>At intervals Jonesie retired to the window-seat
and scowled over his problem. At intervals he arose
hopefully and stared anew at the door. Beyond
it, unsuspecting of the malign influences at work,
Cummings read on in peace. The brief afternoon
darkened to twilight. Across the yard pale lemon-yellow
pin-points of flame struggled above the entrances.
Below the door a thin line of radiance
indicated that Cummings had lighted up. But in
Jonesie’s room darkness crept from the shadowed
corners until only the window remained visible, a
grayish oblong in the encompassing gloom. And
presently the eerie silence was shattered by the
sound of a sinister chuckle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>Daniel Webster Jones, Jr., arose phenomenally
early the next morning and at eight o’clock, having
attended chapel and eaten a hearty, if hurried breakfast,
might have been seen entering the popular
hardware emporium of Bliss &amp; Benedict. At four
minutes to nine, after a return journey through unfrequented
streets and alleys and an entrance to
the building by way of the furnace room door, he
turned the key in the lock of Number 14 and unburdened
himself of numerous packages which he
thereupon secreted where they would be safe from
the prying eyes of the chamber-maid. After which
he seized on certain books and hurried to a nine
o’clock recitation.</p>

<p>It cannot be truthfully said that he was a shining
success in classrooms that morning, although he
managed somehow to “fake” through. His fresh,
cherubic countenance shone with the light of a high
resolve and for the first time in two days he faced
the world with fearless eyes. Whispered jibes fell
from him harmlessly. Instructors, noting his innocence
and nobility, viewed him with a suspicion
born of experience.</p>

<p>At ten-thirty Jonesie had a free half-hour. Returning
to his dormitory he glanced across to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
the second floor of Manning and was filled with
gratitude. For there, in the school infirmary, “Sparrow”
Bowles was interned with mumps. Three days
ago Jonesie had deeply resented his room-mate’s
good fortune, charging the Fates with inexcusable
favoritism, but to-day he had no fault to find. Envy
and all uncharitableness had departed from him.
Indeed, instead of begrudging “Sparrow” his luck,
he sincerely hoped that the malady would continue
for at least a week longer!</p>

<p>I now offer to your attention Talbot Cummings.
Cummings was an Upper Middler, a large, somewhat
ungainly youth of seventeen addicted to bookishness
and boils. But in spite of much reading he
was not a learned nor brilliant youth, and in spite
of the boils he had little of Job’s patience. He
thought rather well of himself, however, and prided
himself on a delicate wit which was really rather
more blatant than delicate. In spite of the fact
that he avoided all forms of athletics and abhorred
physical exertion, he was well-built and, when free
from gauze and surgeon’s plaster, was rather
comely. Upper class fellows viewed him tolerantly
and lower class boys pretended an admiration they
didn’t feel because he had an uncanny ability for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
finding their weak spots and holding them up to
ridicule. As has been said, Cummings lived alone.
In the matter of furnishings he affected artistic
simplicity, leaning toward fumed oak and brown
leather. His study—he liked to call it study rather
than room—was supposed to express individuality.
The table was never littered. There was a very
good-looking drop-light with a near-Tiffany shade,
three or four soberly-clad books, an always-immaculate
blotting-pad and a large bronze ink-well
which, as he invariably wrote with a fountain-pen,
was more ornamental than necessary. So much for
the table. The dresser, instead of being the
repository for numerous photographs and miscellaneous
toilet articles, held a pair of silver-backed
military brushes, a silver shoe-horn and one large
photograph in a silver frame. The bookcase was
always orderly. The window-seat adhered to the
color scheme of brown and tan, the tan necessitated
by the wall paper, which was not of his choosing.
The cushions were of brown ooze leather or craftsman’s
canvas. If I have seemed to dwell overlong
on the room and its furnishings it is for a reason
presently to be perceived.</p>

<p>At a few minutes after twelve that day Cummings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
threw open the door of his study and paused amazed.
Nothing was where it should have been. The lovely
near-Tiffany shade rested precariously atop a pile of
pillows in the middle of the floor. The drop-light
dangled over the edge of the table. The volumes
in the bookcase leaned tipsily outward at various
angles. The silver-framed photograph smiled
blithely from the top of the radiator. And so it
went. Everything was elaborately misplaced. Cummings
viewed and swallowed hard, doubled his fists
and hammered at the portal of Daniel Webster
Jones, Jr. There was no reply and the door proved
to be locked. Bitterly, Cummings vowed that so his
own door should be hereafter! It took him a long
time to restore order and he narrowly escaped being
late for dinner.</p>

<p>He failed to encounter Jonesie until four o’clock.
Then they met in a pool of water in front of
Whipple and Cummings spoke his mind to an
amazed and uncomprehending audience. Cummings
offered to accommodate Jonesie in a number of
ways, to wit: to break his head for him, to kick
him across the yard, to make his nose even stubbier
than it was and to report him to faculty. Jonesie
closed with none of the offers. Instead he viewed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
the irate Cummings with surprise and heard him
patiently, and in the end Cummings was assailed by
doubts, although he didn’t allow the fact to be
known. Surely such an innocent countenance and
demeanor could not hide guile! Fearing that he
might apologize to Jonesie if he remained longer,
he tore himself away, muttering a last unconvincing
threat.</p>

<p>Cummings slept that night, as always, with his
door locked and a chair-back tilted under the knob.
(Once in his first year at Randall’s there had been
a midnight visitation attended by unpleasant and
degrading ceremonies.) In the morning he awoke
to find that the pillows had moved from the window-seat
to the foot of the bed, doubtless accounting for
a certain half-sensed discomfort. Also that his
clothing, left neatly arranged over a chair, now
lay scattered over the floor. He arose in a murderous
mood and tried the door. It was securely locked,
the key was in place and there was the guardian
chair just as he had left it. He cast unjustly suspicious
looks at the eleven-inch transom. It was
closed as usual, nor could it be opened from without
in any case. He went to the window. Below was
a sheer twelve feet of straight brick wall. From his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
casement to the casement on either side the distance
was a good three yards. Then and not until then
his gaze fell on the communicating door and he
said “Ha” triumphantly and seized the knob. It
came forth in his hands and he staggered half across
the room. When he had recovered himself he said
“Huh!” But further investigations left him still
puzzled, for the stout bolt on his own side of the
door was shot into its socket and secured. Cummings
went to breakfast in a detached frame of
mind that caused him to walk into Mr. Mundy, the
Hall Master, in the corridor, and, later, to say “yes”
when he meant to say “no.” As a result of the
latter mistake “Puffin” Welch seized on his second
roll and devoured it before Cummings awoke to the
situation.</p>

<p>Thus, then, began the amazing series of depredatory
visitations that befell Talbot Cummings; or,
rather, his study, for so long as he was on hand
nothing befell. All one morning he remained uncomfortably
concealed beneath the bed, thereby
cutting four recitations and being obliged to invent
an unconvincing attack of toothache. And while
he lay there, inhaling dust, he heard Jonesie arrive
gayly next door, remain for a half-hour of song<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
and depart lightsomely. It was while he was
describing that toothache to the Principal that
vandalism again occurred. When he returned, far
from happy, he found that, in spite of locked door
and window, his near-Tiffany shade sat on the rug
surmounted by “Travels in Arctic Lands” and the
bronze ink-well, the latter, fortunately, empty. The
silver-framed photograph lay on its face and the
contents of the lower dresser drawer, or most of
them, were lying about the floor. Cummings dropped
into a chair, grabbed his neatly-arranged hair in
both hands and raged.</p>

<p>Like most persons who appreciate a joke on another,
Cummings hated ridicule when directed
against himself. It was principally for this reason
that for three days he kept the matter quiet. A
lesser reason was that he didn’t like to believe that
anyone was smarter than Talbot Cummings and
that he thought he could eventually outwit the perpetrator
of the dastardly deeds. His suspicions had
long since returned irrevocably to Jonesie. He recalled
the incident of the composition and Jonesie’s
threats to get even. But there was no use charging
that youth again with the crime until he had proof,
and proof was not forthcoming. At first he suspected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
Jonesie of having a duplicate key to the
corridor door, but reflection told him that all the
duplicate keys in the world wouldn’t allow Jonesie
or anyone else to enter the room and retire without
disturbing the key that was on the inside or the
chair that was under the knob. And after he had
added a specially large and heavy bolt he was still
more certain that the vandal did not come in that
way. Neither did he enter by the window. He
proved that by locking it and finding it still locked
after the bed-clothes had transferred themselves to
the window-seat. Nor was it possible that Jonesie
came in by the communicating door, for there was
the undisturbed bolt, a key-hole filled with sealing-wax
and a piece of paper still reposing between door
and frame, just where Cummings had craftily placed
it. Cummings spent so much time trying to solve
the mystery that studies suffered and he was spoken
to harshly more than once. The thing even began
to affect his appetite, and at last, when seven
separate times he had found his study turned topsy-turvy,
he offered an armistice.</p>

<p>“Come in!” called Jonesie.</p>

<p>Entered Cummings, smiling knowingly, and seated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
himself with a fine nonchalance. Jonesie, looking
up from Latin, eyed him with disfavor.</p>

<p>“What you grinning about?” he demanded coldly.</p>

<p>Cummings winked and leered. “You win,” he
announced cheerfully, and managed a deprecatory
laugh. Jonesie frowned darkly.</p>

<p>“Win what?”</p>

<p>“You know. I don’t know how you do it—That
is, I’m not certain, but I have an idea. Anyhow,
it’s clever, Jonesie. You had me guessing at first,
all right. But I guess we’re quits now, eh?”</p>

<p>“Would you mind giving me a hint? I’ve got
Latin and math to get and there isn’t much time for
conundrums, Cummings. If it’s one of the ‘What’s-the-difference-between’
kind, I never could guess
those.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t keep it up. I tell you I give in, don’t
I? What more do you want?”</p>

<p>“Say, what are you gabbing about, anyway?” inquired
Jonesie crossly. “If you’ve got something
on your mind come out with it.”</p>

<p>“You know plaguey well what I’m talking about,”
replied Cummings, losing his temper. “I came in
here ready to call quits. If you won’t have it, all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
right. Then I’ll go to Faculty. A joke’s a joke,
but you don’t need to keep it up forever!”</p>

<p>“Of course not; that’s what they call <em>monotony</em>,”
Jonesie agreed blandly. Cummings scowled.</p>

<p>“You think you’re smart, don’t you? Well, you
won’t when you get hauled up at the Office.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“What for! For—for making a beastly pig-pen
of my study! For upsetting my things! You know
what for!”</p>

<p>“Not <em>again</em>?” exclaimed Jonesie in shocked tones.</p>

<p>“Half a dozen times! More! I’m sick of it. A
joke’s a joke——”</p>

<p>“You said that before,” said the other, sweetly.
“Now look here, Cummings: you blamed me two
or three days ago for ‘pieing’ your room. I stood
for that, but I’m not going to have you keep it
up all——”</p>

<p>“Then you quit——”</p>

<p>“—The year. If—if you annoy me any more
with—with your unjust accusations I’ll go straight
to Faculty. It—it’s getting <em>monotonous</em>.”</p>

<p>Cummings’s jaw fell and for a moment speech
deserted him. At last: “<em>You’ll</em> go to Faculty! Ha,
ha! Why, you—you little button-nosed——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>“Never mind my nose. At least I keep it out of
other fellows’ affairs! I don’t——”</p>

<p>“You keep it out of my study then! Just once
more——”</p>

<p>“Don’t be an ass, Cummings,” begged Jonesie.
“How could I get into your old study if the door’s
locked? Use your bean.”</p>

<p>“I don’t <em>know</em> how you do it! I wish I did!
But you <em>do</em> it! I’m sick of it. And you’ll break
something first thing you know! I—I ought to
knock the stuffing out of you, Jonesie, that’s what
I ought to do. I’ve stood mor’n most fellows would
stand.”</p>

<p>“Try it and see what happens, old dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you’d run to Faculty with it!”</p>

<p>“Like a shot,” agreed Jonesie.</p>

<p>“All right, two can do that. It’ll be probation
for you just as soon——”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t frighten me. When a fellow’s
conscience is clear——”</p>

<p>“Yah!” Cummings made for the door. “We’ll
see! Just wait!”</p>

<p>“Right-o! But, I say, Cummings. If you want
to know what I think, I think it’s spooks!”</p>

<p>Cummings slammed the door behind him and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
Jonesie looking past the green-shaded drop-light,
fixed his gaze on a recently acquired article of
adornment, a large, brightly-colored calendar, which
hung on the knobless door, and winked gravely.</p>

<p>“Funny about Cummings’s spooks, isn’t it?” observed
Jonesie later to Turner, of the Lower
Middle.</p>

<p>“Haven’t heard,” replied Turner eagerly. “What
is it?”</p>

<p>Jonesie seemed surprised at the other’s ignorance
and enlightened it. He really made a very interesting
yarn of it and when he had finished Turner
was grinning from ear to ear. “Fine!” he chortled.
“Oh, corking! And, say, Jonesie.” Turner’s right
eye closed slyly. “Of course <em>you</em> know nothing
about it, eh?”</p>

<p>“Me? Give you my word, Tom, I haven’t set
foot in his room in weeks! Besides, how could I?
How could any fellow, with his door locked and
everything? It’s spooks, that’s what it is.”</p>

<p>Turner was Randall’s nearest approach to a town
crier. If Jonesie didn’t want the story to spread
he shouldn’t have told Turner. It was careless of
him, for inside of two hours the mysterious happenings
in Talbot Cummings’s room were known<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
all over the school. Cummings attempted denial,
but it was no use. Randall’s had found a new sensation
and refused to be deprived of it. Cummings
had to tell his story over and over, until he was
sick and tired of it. It wouldn’t have been so bad
had it been accepted seriously, but it wasn’t. His
audiences invariably became hilarious and offered
all sorts of nonsensical advice, like putting sticky
fly-paper on the floor, erecting barbed-wire entanglements
or ringing burglar-alarms. The younger boys,
long intimidated, fairly haunted Cummings and
with solemn countenances begged to be told about
the spooks. His room became a Mecca for the
curious and he had no privacy. Cummings was
most unhappy, so unhappy that when he awoke the
following morning and, in spite of having laid
awake and watchful until well after two, found his
counterpane abloom like a flower garden with his
neckties, he metaphorically threw up the sponge.
Those ties had been neatly arranged in the top
drawer of his dresser, and the top drawer was
now not only tightly closed but the key was turned
in the lock! It was too much! It was—yes, sir,
it was spooky! Cummings dressed hurriedly and
tumbled down to Mr. Mundy’s study and incoherently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
told his tale. Mr. Mundy was young
and a man of action. In four minutes he was at
the scene of the crime.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he owned to defeat. He had
found the window secured, the door between the
rooms showed that it had not been opened at least
in months by the accumulation of dust and lint in
the interstices, the transom was impossible and
Cummings had shown him how the corridor door
had been fastened: lock turned and key left cross-wise,
bolt shot and engaged, chair wedged under
knob. Mr. Mundy frowned and shook his head.
There was just one explanation. He offered it
kindly. “What you’ve been doing, my boy, is walking
in your sleep. Maybe you don’t get enough
exercise during the day. Then sleeping with everything
shut up like this——”</p>

<p>“But I don’t walk in my sleep in the daytime,
do I?” asked Cummings wildly. Mr. Mundy
looked blank.</p>

<p>“N-no, but are you—ahem—are you quite certain——”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” declared Cummings bitterly. “It’s
<em>worse</em> in the daytime.”</p>

<p>“Hum. And he denies it utterly?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, he does, but I know it’s him, Mr.
Mundy!”</p>

<p>“<em>He</em>,” corrected the instructor from force of
habit. “I’ll have a talk with him. Stay here.”</p>

<p>Jonesie opened promptly, the picture of smiling
innocence. And he spoke <em>so</em> convincingly! “Mr.
Mundy, I really think you’d ought to do something
about him, sir,” he said concernedly. “He comes
in here and tells the strangest stories and accuses
me of annoying him. He says I go into his room
and disarrange his things when he’s out. He even
says I do it when he’s in bed. He’s threatened to
lick me, sir.” Cummings, listening beyond the
door, shook a fist helplessly. “You know that isn’t
right, sir,” pleaded Jonesie. “He says himself he
locks the room up tight. I ask you, sir, how I
could get in there if I wanted to.”</p>

<p>“Quite so, Jones, quite so, but—ahem—hasn’t
there been some ill-feeling between you two recently?”</p>

<p>“Why, he came in here and swiped a composition
of mine off the table and read it to the fellows
and had a laugh on me, but that was days ago
and I don’t care anything about it <em>now</em>, sir. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
he’d just stop having these—these hallucinations
of his——”</p>

<p>“Hallucinations, eh?” Mr. Mundy repressed a
smile. “I wonder.” He sauntered to the communicating
door and studied it attentively. He
even lifted the large and brilliant calendar and
looked behind it, and Jonesie, watching politely and
imperturbably, blinked twice. Then Mr. Mundy
gazed at the place where the knob should have
been.</p>

<p>“Where’s the knob?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir. It’s been gone a long while.”</p>

<p>“Hm.” The instructor seemed about to ask a
second question, but changed his mind. Instead,
he threw his weight against the door. It didn’t even
creak. He turned to Jonesie.</p>

<p>“When was the last time you were in Cummings’s
room?” he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“About nine weeks ago, sir. It was before
Christmas recess.”</p>

<p>“That’s the absolute truth, Jones?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir!” Jonesie looked slightly hurt.</p>

<p>“Very well. That’s all. If I were you I’d—ahem—I’d
find that knob, Jones. Or one like it.”</p>

<p>The door closed behind the instructor and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
Jonesie subsided in the nearest chair, grinning like
the famous Cheshire Cat.</p>

<p>Next door Mr. Mundy spoke firmly but kindly
to Cummings. “If I were you,” he said, “I’d go
in for some sort of regular exercise besides your
gymnasium work. Be out of doors more, Cummings.
You might take a good long walk every
day; three or four miles. Aren’t worrying about
anything, are you?”</p>

<p>“I’m worrying about having my room upset
every time I turn my back,” said the boy excitedly.
“That’s what——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” soothed Mr. Mundy. “But I think
if you’ll follow my advice regarding the walks and
being out of doors you’ll find that—ahem—your
worries will cease. About three miles to-day, to
start with, eh? And drop in this evening and tell
me where you went and what you saw.” He nodded
encouragingly and departed.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, Cummings did just what Jonesie
had done a minute before. That is, he subsided
into a chair. But he didn’t grin. He groaned.
“<em>Three miles!</em>” he muttered. “<em>Great Scott!</em>”</p>

<p>But he did them. He didn’t dare not to. And
when he stumbled back, at five, foot-sore and aching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
from the unaccustomed effort, he found his
study sickeningly confused. “It’s fine for <em>him</em>,”
he thought bitterly. “He knows I’m safe out of
the way for an hour. Mundy makes me sick!”</p>

<p>Supper that evening was torture, for he was
tired and discouraged to start with and everyone
he met asked about his spooks. He lost his temper
completely with Turner and that youth had the
cheek to read him a lecture on manners. He anticipated
some satisfaction in reporting to Mr.
Mundy that his walk had not prevented the “pieing”
of his study, but the instructor told him that
he mustn’t expect his prescription to work so soon.
“Keep on, Cummings,” he said cheerfully. “It’ll
soon tell. Try four miles to-morrow.”</p>

<p>But Cummings was through. He climbed wearily
upstairs and knocked at Number 14. “When
do you want to quit, Jonesie?” he asked humbly.</p>

<p>“I won’t pretend to ignorance of your meaning,”
replied Jonesie grandly. “I’ve been thinking about
your case, Cummings, and I’ve solved it.” Cummings
moistened his lips but said nothing. “It’s
your conscience that’s at the bottom of all this,
old man. I believe that if you clear your conscience
you’ll stop imagining things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>“Imagining!” gasped Cummings.</p>

<p>Jonesie nodded. “You have something on your
conscience, haven’t you? You’ve done something
you’re sorry for? Something you repent of,
Cummings?”</p>

<p>Cummings nodded, all fight gone. “I guess so,”
he muttered. “I—I’m sorry, Jonesie. I apologize.”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“You know. Reading that composition.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Why, I’d most forgotten that. So many
things have happened since to—to vary the <em>monotony</em>,
Cummings. But it’s decent of you to apologize,
old man. And I accept it. I never hold grudges,
Cummings. That’s not my way. If I can’t show
fellows somehow that they have made a mistake,
why, I forget it. So <em>that’s</em> all right.”</p>

<p>“And—and it won’t happen again?” pleaded
Cummings.</p>

<p>“Not if my theory is right, old dear, and I think
it is. In fact I almost think I can promise, Cummings,
that it won’t happen again.”</p>

<p>It didn’t. Jonesie’s theory was vindicated.</p>

<p>Three days later “Sparrow” Bowles returned
from the infirmary, and one of the first things he
did was to take exception to Jonesie’s beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
calendar. But if he hoped to start something he
was disappointed. “That’s all right,” said Jonesie,
“take it down. I’m through with it, anyway.” So
“Sparrow” removed it, and, having done so, regarded
the door closely.</p>

<p>“Someone,” said “Sparrow,” “has been monkeying
with this panel. Looks to me like it had been
out. That’s funny!”</p>

<p>Jonesie yawned. “Maybe the heat’s loosened it,”
he suggested.</p>

<p>A few days later “Sparrow” observed: “Hello,
I didn’t know you had one of these electric
torches.”</p>

<p>“There’s a lot you don’t know, son,” said
Jonesie; adding to himself: “You don’t know what
can be done with a fishing rod with a piece of wire
on the end of it, for one thing!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TQ">THE QUITTER</h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">They were revising the line-up for the final
game of the season, that with Fairfield,
when Jack Groom entered: Coach Thornton,
Payson Walsh, manager; Larry Logan, quarterback;
and Jim Walsh, left guard. Had Tinker,
the trainer, been on hand too, the Board of Football
Strategy of Staunton School would have been,
with Jack’s advent, complete. “Tink’s” absence,
however, had been discounted: and the same was
true of Jack, for none of those in the coach’s study
had expected the captain to hobble all that half-mile
between campus and village. There were four
simultaneous exclamations of surprise when he appeared
in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Oh, Doc says I’m out of it for good,” defended
Jack. He lowered himself into a chair, leaned his
crutches alongside and scowled malignantly at the
bulky swathings of his right foot.</p>

<p>“Maybe, son, but you don’t want to have trouble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
with that ankle, even if you can’t play,” said Mr.
Thornton.</p>

<p>“I’ve got all winter to coddle it,” Jack growled.
“Shove that footstool over, Larry, will you? Well,
what have you decided?”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t much to decide, Cap,” replied the
coach. “With you out of it——”</p>

<p>“Preston or Morely.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. And it’s Preston, to my mind.” There
was a suggestion of challenge in Mr. Thornton’s
voice. Jack glanced at the others. Logan nodded,
and so did Payson Walsh, but his brother remained
non-committal.</p>

<p>“Ted Morely played a pretty snappy game to-day
after I came out,” suggested Jack.</p>

<p>“Oh, Morely’s all right,” agreed the coach, “but
in my opinion Preston’s a better man to start the
game Saturday. We’ve got to get the jump on
Fairfield, Cap, and to do that we ought to start
with the best we have. Morely’s smart and fast
and—and snappy, but I consider Preston more dependable.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said the manager. “Ted’s a quitter.”</p>

<p>Jack turned to him, but Jim Walsh was quicker.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
“Cut that, Pay,” he growled. “You never saw Ted
Morely quit in your life.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know what I mean,” his brother protested.
“Maybe he isn’t a quitter, exactly, but—he
quits! Doesn’t he, now? Didn’t he lie down in
the Fielding game? Oh, I know he did something
to his shoulder, but he was all right the next morning.
It couldn’t have been much. I like Ted, but
when it comes to picking a right half for Saturday——”</p>

<p>“The trouble is that he’s always getting hurt,”
said Logan.</p>

<p>“He’s all right now,” Jack said. “He has had
punk luck, I’ll grant you, but being laid up a couple
of times hasn’t got anything to do with Saturday.
And you say yourselves that he played a snappy
game to-day.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it matters an awful lot,” said the
coach. “It isn’t likely the chap who starts will
finish, anyway. But you’re captain, and if you say
Morely——”</p>

<p>“I’m not captain any longer,” returned Jack.
“Larry had better take it on, hadn’t he? As for
using Ted, I haven’t anything to say. Only you’re
wrong about him. He’s played in hard luck, that’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
all. I knew him back home. He didn’t play football
then, but he was always a mighty spunky chap,
and I never saw anything that looked like quitting.
He is a bit light, but he’s a fighter, and he can do
more damage in a broken field than anyone we have.
I’ve heard fellows say, or intimate, just what Pay
said a minute ago; that Ted’s a quitter. It’s too
bad, for it’s a rank injustice, and I’d like to see
him have a chance to prove it. But I’m not going
to insist on playing him. You’re running this show,
Coach, and after this minute I’m not going to have
another word to say about it. After this Larry’s
captain. I’m out of it.”</p>

<p>“Field captain, of course,” said the coach.
“You’re still the real captain, Jack, and we want
your advice and your help as much as ever.”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing!” Jack shook his head. “You
won’t hear me open my mouth again, Thornton.
I’m off. Anyone going up?”</p>

<p>“I’ll go along, I guess,” said Jim Walsh. “You
don’t need me any more, do you, Coach?”</p>

<p>“No, I guess not. We don’t have to decide about
Morely until the game starts, anyway, Cap. If you
still think——”</p>

<p>“I’ve stopped thinking,” answered Jack, smiling,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
as he worked his crutches under his arm and, aided
by Jim, swung himself up. “Good-night, everybody.”</p>

<p>“Hard luck,” said Payson Walsh as the departing
couple passed down the short brick walk to the
street and went off through the rustling leaves that
lay thick on the sidewalk. “Poor Jack! I’ll bet
he’s feeling perfectly rotten.”</p>

<p>“I know he is,” said Larry Logan. “When Jack
doesn’t laugh once in a quarter of an hour——”
He shook his head eloquently.</p>

<p>“We’ll miss him Saturday,” mused the coach. “I
don’t mean any reflection on you, Logan.”</p>

<p>“I know. A team always feels lost without its
captain. It’s going to make a difference in our
chances of winning, too. I still think we can pull
it out, but—we’ll have to work harder to do it.”</p>

<p>“Funny to have it happen in a game like to-day’s,”
grumbled the manager. “Why, it was the
easiest game of the season!”</p>

<p>“You never can tell about that,” replied Logan.
“You get hurt when you least expect it. Remember
two years ago when Tommy Winship broke his arm
in the gym? He didn’t fall three feet! Well——”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
He stretched and yawned widely. “Gee, I’m tired!
It was too blamed hot to-day for football.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the coach agreed, absently. He was making
meaningless marks on the edge of the paper
before him. After a moment: “I suppose it would
be a decent thing to please Jack under the circumstances
and start Morely instead of Preston,” he
said thoughtfully. “I don’t believe it would matter
much, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Pleasing Jack isn’t what we’re here for,” said
Payson Walsh, frowning. “We want to win a week
from to-day, Coach. That’s our stunt. Ted
Morely’s a sort of protegé of Jack’s, and Jack thinks
Ted’s been misjudged, and he wants to give the
chap a chance to prove it. He said so himself.
But we’re not staging the contest for Morely’s
benefit. If he’s got the reputation of being a quitter—and
as a matter of fact he has, as you know,
Larry—it’s his own fault. It isn’t up to us to
worry. Preston’s the man for the job and I say,
use him.”</p>

<p>The coach nodded. “You’re probably right,” he
said.</p>

<p>Had Ted Morely known what was being said
about him down in the village he would not have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
sped his pen so calmly over the paper, but, as it
was, he was at peace with the world. He was writing
of the afternoon’s game at length and with,
perhaps, unnecessary detail, for his father and
mother knew woefully little about football. Having
reached the end of the third page, he laid down
his pen and read over his effort.</p>

<p>“It was rotten luck for Jack, and everyone’s awfully
sorry for him. They say he’s quite out of the
Fairfield game. Isn’t that the limit? I haven’t
seen him since they lugged him off the field, but
I guess he’s beastly cut up about it. I took his place
after he was hurt and played all of the fourth quarter.
You know I’ve been fighting Preston all Fall,
and now it looks like I’d won. Anyway, if Jack
doesn’t play Saturday I’m bound to get in sooner
or later, for Fairfield plays a stiff game and not
many fellows last through. To-day we were 17
to their 7 when I went in and Thornton ran in a lot
of subs and we only tried to hold the other fellow
from scoring any more. You needn’t worry about
my shoulder because it’s just as good as it ever was.
I wouldn’t have said anything about it if it had been
serious——”</p>

<p>He scored that out heavily and wrote above it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
“It was only a wrench and nothing to bother about.
I’ve been in mean luck this Fall about getting
bunged up. You remember I had tonsilitis when
we played Camden High and then there was the
time I sort of fainted at practice one day, but that
was only something I’d eaten, the doctor said, and
then hurting that old shoulder took me out of the
Fielding game. I’ll bet you that if they let me play
Saturday there won’t be anything the matter with
me, or if there is no one will know it! We want
to win this year pretty bad and the school’s made
up its mind to do it, too. I wish you could see
some of the meetings we’ve been having. Talk
about enthusiasm, gee, no one’s got anything on
us. Well, I’ll write again after the game and you’ll
know then how it comes out. If you want to know
before that you will find it in the Reading paper,
I guess. Now I must stop and go to bed. I’ve
written a pretty long letter for me. Lots of love
to you both.”</p>

<p>He signed it “Your aff. son, Ted,” folded it
away into the envelope, wrote the address and
leaned the letter against the drop-light so that he
would see it and remember to borrow a stamp from
his room-mate and post it the next morning. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
with a comfortable yawn, he arose and removed his
jacket. In doing so he winced slightly, frowned
and rubbed his left shoulder a moment before he
began to wind the old-fashioned silver watch that
had been his father’s and had descended to him on
his sixteenth birthday, nearly a year ago. When
his room-mate came in Ted was fast asleep and
dreaming brave dreams.</p>

<p>Toward Jack Groom, Ted entertained an admiration
that was closely akin to hero worship. Jack
was not quite two years older, but to Ted he seemed
more than that, and with liking went a respectful
awe that to-day, the Sunday following the next to
the last game of the Staunton schedule, kept Ted
from doing what he really wanted to do, which was
cross the yard to Fenton Hall and call on the captain.
He wanted to let Jack know that he was
horribly sorry about the accident and very sympathetic,
but he was very much afraid of being
thought presumptuous: only to himself Ted called
it “fresh.” Ultimately he did go, but it was because
Milton, Jack’s room-mate, hailed him after dinner
with: “O Morely! Jack wants to see you. He’s
over in the room. Run over now, will you?”</p>

<p>Jack was propped up on the window-seat when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
Ted entered, his offending foot pillowed before him.
Ted’s condolences stumblingly uttered, Jack came to
the reason for the summons. “I can’t play Saturday,
Ted,” he announced, “and so I’ve dropped out
of it entirely. Logan’s taken my place. I haven’t
any more say about things. I wanted you to
know that because it looks as if Preston would
have the call over you. I think Thornton will start
him Saturday. I’m sorry, Ted. I think you could
play as good a game as Preston, maybe better, but
Thornton thinks you’re a bit light. Of course,
you’ll get in before the game’s over. You can’t
help it, I guess. And, in any case, Thornton’ll see
that you get your letter. I just wanted you to understand
that it isn’t my doing, Ted.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” muttered the younger boy vaguely.
“That’s all right, Jack. I—Preston——” He
paused and swallowed. “I guess he’s better than
I am, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Piffle! Next year you’ll put it all over him.
Don’t mind about Saturday, old man. You’ve got
another year yet.”</p>

<p>Which, reflected Ted, retracing his steps under
the leafless maples, was true but not very consoling
at the moment. He wished he had not written<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
home with so much assurance. Still, if anything
happened to Preston early in the game—not that he
wished Preston ill-luck, of course. That would be
pretty low-down. But accidents did happen! However,
he put that line of conjecture out of his mind
presently and strove to find comfort in the patriotic
reflection that if Preston was preferred by the coach
it was with good reason and meant that Staunton’s
chances of winning would be bettered. And, after
all, what everyone wanted, Ted amongst them, was
a victory over Fairfield. By Monday afternoon he
had learned to accept the disappointment with a fair
degree of philosophy.</p>

<p>The coach’s intentions were not apparent during
practice, either that day or on any other of the
remaining work days. Ted and Preston were used
alternately at right half and no favoritism was discernible.
Preston, thought Ted, was worried and
nervous. The fight for supremacy was telling on
him and Tuesday afternoon he called down the
coaches’ condemnation by twice “gumming up”
plays. Ted knew that he was thinking too hard
about Saturday’s contest to do justice to himself.
As for Ted, he had seldom played the position better.
Certain that the struggle was over, the consequent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
relief allowed him to put all his mind on
his game, with the result that he went at it in a
hammer-and-tongs style that was almost spectacular.
He managed to forget very completely that
Saturday would find him on the bench instead of
on the field, and got a lot of joy and satisfaction
from the moment. But after practice on Tuesday
he got to thinking about Preston, and when Fate
arranged a meeting on the gymnasium steps he
yielded to an impulse. He and Preston were always
extremely polite to each other, formally friendly,
as became antagonists who thoroughly respected
each other.</p>

<p>“I say, Preston,” began Ted, “I—there’s something
you ought to know. I heard it by—by accident,
but I know it’s straight.” Preston looked
politely curious. “Thornton’s decided on you to
start the game,” blurted Ted. “I thought you’d like
to know it. Now you won’t have to—to worry, you
see.”</p>

<p>“Why, thanks, Morely, but—you’re not stringing
me, are you? Where did you hear it?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you that, but it’s—official.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Well, but—it’s a bit tough on you, Morely.
Maybe you’re wrong. You’d better wait and see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t need to.” Ted smiled. “I know. I’m
telling you so you can—can buckle down to business,
Preston. You see, I know what it is to have
the other fellow on your mind all the time! One
of us had to lose out, Preston, and it happens to be
me. Thornton thinks I’m too light. I dare say he’s
right. Anyway, he’s the doctor, and as long as we
beat Fairfield I don’t mind. Much,” he added as a
sop to Truth.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s mighty decent of you,” said Preston
warmly. “You’ve certainly given me a dandy scrap,
and I don’t mind telling you that you’ve had me
worried pretty often. I hope you get your letter.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. Maybe I will. So long.”</p>

<p>The last practice was on Wednesday and was
largely signal work, although the kickers had a
fairly stiff session later. On Thursday the school
marched over to the field and cheered and sang and
the first team substitutes went through a twenty-minute
contest with the second eleven. Ted didn’t
see it, for he was sent back to the gymnasium with
the first squad, but he could hear the onlookers
cheering the disbanding second when the scrimmage
was over. And a few minutes later, while he was
tying his shoe-laces, the marching, enthusiastic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
horde grouped in front of the gymnasium entrance
and cheered the players individually, and the coaches
and the trainer and everyone else. Ted listened
rather anxiously for his own name. It came presently.
He was somehow very glad of that. He
would have felt horribly disappointed had they left
him out.</p>

<p>Fairfield descended on the scene in force Saturday
noon and the Campus and the village and the
road between were gay with the flaunting blue of
the enemy. The day was an Indian summer day,
still, warm and hazy in the distances. Ted trotted
with the rest to the field at a quarter to two and
went through the warming up stunts. Then he
donned a blanket and watched while the rival captains
met in mid-field and a coin spun glittering
in the sunlight. Fairfield had won the toss and had
elected to give the ball to Staunton, thus upsetting
Coach Thornton’s prophecy.</p>

<p>“All right now,” announced the latter. He referred
to the little red book he carried in a vest
pocket. “Aikens, Breadwell, Boyd, Morris, Walsh,
Denton, Conley, Logan, Moore, Preston and Farnsworth.
On the run, fellows!”</p>

<p>Presently a whistle piped, the new brown pigskin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
arose high against the blue sky and the final test
of the long season’s work was begun. The cheering
had stilled on both sides of the field and some two
thousand pairs of eyes followed the long flight of
the ball. Then a Fairfield half-back had it and
was dodging back up the gridiron. Breadwell almost
got him, but he slipped past. Then Larry
Logan wrapped two sturdy arms about the runner’s
legs and brought him crashing to the yellowed
turf. Fairfield came hard then and Ted watched
anxiously as the Staunton line bent and buckled
against the heavy assault. But the line didn’t break
much and presently the ball was in air again. Then
came the first trial of the Staunton wide-open attack,
and a mighty shout arose as Moore burst
through outside right guard and reeled past two
white lines. Again Moore got through, and then
the Fairfield defense solved the play and shifted to
meet it, and Farnsworth, faking a kick and then
plunging at the Fairfield left, was spilled behind his
line. A forward pass failed and again the ball flew
through the air, propelled by Farnsworth’s boot,
and the teams raced down to the Blue’s thirty-yard
line. That quarter ended without anything approaching
a score, the honors even. But Thornton’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
plan to “get the jump” on the enemy and score
in the first few minutes of play had failed.</p>

<p>The second period was a repetition of the first,
save that Fairfield had the ball once on Staunton’s
twenty-two yards on a fourth down and missed a
goal from the field by a bare half-foot margin. Ted
trotted back to the gymnasium with the others and
sat around in an atmosphere of steam and liniment
and excitement and listened to the babel of voices.
Jack was in uniform but had not joined the players
for a moment, and <a href="#i_frontis">it was Larry Logan who fumed
and implored</a> and advised. Coach Thornton looked
confident and had little to say until just before half-time
was up. Then he made a quietly forceful appeal
and, at the end, called for a cheer. Thirty-two
voices answered thunderously.</p>

<p>Fairfield scored two minutes after the third
period started. The kick-off was fumbled by
Logan, and, although he fell on it, at his eighteen
yards, Fairfield blocked Farnsworth’s punt and an
end broke through and captured the trickling pigskin
a foot behind the goal line. Fairfield brought
the ball out in triumph, and it was then that Ted
saw that one brown-legged player was stretched on
the turf. “Tink” was diving toward him with slopping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
bucket. Ted’s eyes sped from player to player
of his side. Only Preston was missing along the
goal line! Something pushed his heart into his
throat, turned it over once and let it slip slowly
back again. He watched “Tink’s” sponge in fascination.
Then they were lifting Preston to his feet.
For an instant it seemed that he was as good as
ever, but suddenly his head fell over sideways.
They were carrying him off now, bringing him to
the bench. Someone amongst the subs leaped forward
with a blanket. The stand behind was cheering
bravely for “Preston! Preston! Preston!”
Thornton met the slowly-approaching group at the
side line, looked, listened to a word from Tinker
and whirled on his heel.</p>

<p>“Morely! Get in there! Hurry up!” he called.</p>

<p>Ted squirmed from his sweater and raced. Panting,
he slipped between Breadwell and Moore under
the cross-bar and waited. A hand waved downward,
the ball flew toward them, there was a moment
of suspense and a roar of relief arose from
the Staunton stand. Fairfield had failed at the goal.
Six points to nothing was the score, and virtually
half the game remained to be played.</p>

<p>Larry Logan shot a dubious look at Ted as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
latter fell into place beside Moore when Fairfield
had the ball again on her own thirty-four yards.
But he managed a cheerful: “All right, Ted! Let’s
see what you can do! Hard, now!”</p>

<p>But it was Fairfield’s policy to slow up now, and
she halted in her signals and wasted all the time she
could without risking a penalty. Staunton held
gamely and then spoiled a forward pass and took
the ball on downs. The wide-open attack was still
working, for Fairfield’s men were a bit heavier and
a bit slower and Logan was getting a lot of jump
into his plays. Ted got his chance and crashed
through for a scant three yards, got it again and
was downed almost in his tracks by an unguarded
end. Then Moore slipped around right tackle and
ran twelve yards before he was forced over the side
line. Staunton got to the enemy’s twenty-three
before she was held, and then Farnsworth tried a
place kick and missed the goal by five yards.</p>

<p>And so it went, Fairfield sparring for time,
Staunton forcing the playing, smashing desperately,
running hard, aching to score. Changes were made.
Morris went out at center and young Joyce took his
place. Greenough came in for Breadwell. With
three minutes of the quarter left the ball was Staunton’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
in mid-field. Loring had wasted a down on
a weird trick play that had lost four yards and now
Farnsworth was called on. It was the old fake
kick and wide run, but it worked, just as it so
often does, and the big full-back galloped over three
white streaks before they stopped him. Then, with
the line-up close to the side of the field, Logan
called on Ted. Moore crossed over in front of him,
Farnsworth ran with him. Larry hid the ball a
moment and then, as Ted rushed past, thumped it
against his stomach. The Fairfield line was wide
open in the middle and Ted went through like a
shot. After that he had to spin and feint and
dodge, but he kept going forward, kept wresting
himself from clutching hands, kept passing the lines
underfoot. The goal came closer and closer and
for a wonderful moment he thought he was going
to make it. But the Fairfield quarter spoiled that.
He refused to believe in Ted’s move toward the
side line and got him firmly about the knees and
wouldn’t be kicked loose. And then, when Ted
toppled to earth, clutching the ball frenziedly, a pursuing
end crashed down upon him and a million
stars blazed before Ted’s astonished eyes and he
fainted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>When he came around, barely a half-minute later,
they were pumping his arms and he had to gasp
with the pain of it. Then came Tinker and the
water pail and the big, dripping, smelly sponge, and
Tinker’s anxious: “Where’d they get you, boy?”</p>

<p>Ted did a lot of thinking in something under a
second. Too often already this season had he had
to be led off the field. He dared “Tink’s” searching
eyes and gasped: “Nowhere ... Tink. I’m ...
all right!”</p>

<p>“You’re not! Don’t be telling lies.” Tinker’s
crafty fingers went exploring. Up one leg, down
another, over the boy’s chest—Ted never flinched.
He smiled railingly.</p>

<p>“Let me up, you ninny,” he expostulated. “I’m
all right. That fellow knocked the breath out of
me, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Tinker doubted and looked it. But he dropped
the sponge back into the pail and stood up. “Come
on, then,” he commanded. “Let’s see.”</p>

<p>Ted raised himself with his right hand and
sprang nimbly enough to his feet, laughing. Tinker
grunted, shot a suspicious look, saw no evidences
of injury and swooped down on his pail. “All
right!” he said. “Go to it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>It was Moore who gained the next two yards
and Moore who lost them again. Farnsworth
bucked through past guard for four. It was maddening
to be on the eleven yards with only one
down left and six to go. Larry hesitated and the
enemy jeered. A forward pass was all that would
answer, and Staunton’s forwards had signally failed
all the afternoon. But what must be must be and
Larry gave the signals. It was Farnsworth who
remonstrated. Larry listened to his whispers and
looked doubtful and finally shook his head. But
shaking his head was only camouflage, for the signals
were changed. Ted’s heart leaped as he heard
them. Then the silence of the portentous instant
before the impact, and the signals repeated, and
Ted taking the ball on a longish pass from Joyce
and springing away to the left, with Moore interfering.
Then came the frenzied cry of “<em>In! In!</em>”
and, sure enough, as Moore went down, a hole
opened, and Ted, pivoting, turned toward the goal
line. It was only a few yards distant, but the Blue’s
backs were flocking to its defense and Ted was
already in the midst of them. Arms settled at his
waist, but he tore away. Someone crashed into him
from behind and he was flung forward, his feet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
stumbling behind him. They got him then. A hand
brushed past his face and thumped down on his left
shoulder and Ted gasped and doubled up and went
down, vainly, as it seemed, trying to push the pigskin
forward as the trampled turf leaped up to meet
him. And as he fell he found himself saying to
himself in a darkness lurid with whirling stars and
meteors: “I won’t faint! I won’t faint!”</p>

<p>He didn’t, but he lay very still when they pulled
the foe from him and he had to be fairly lifted to
his feet. And when he was on them he could only
lean against Farnsworth and whisper gaspingly:
“Don’t let go of me, please! Just a minute! Just
a minute!” So Farnsworth, grinning happily, for
the ball was over the line by three inches, held him
up and no one paid much attention to the fact.
Presently things stopped whirling madly around in
Ted’s world and he groped his way back to the
gridiron and dazedly watched while Farnsworth,
after much cogitation amidst a great silence, lifted
the pigskin straight over the cross-bar!</p>

<p>The quarter ended a moment later and the teams
changed places. Staunton fought for time now,
as Fairfield had done before, but went to no undue
lengths to secure it. She was a point to the good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
and would have been satisfied had the game ended
then and there, but she had also learned the joy
of battle and was willing to fight on. Fairfield came
back with a desperation that for the first few
minutes lifted the home team from her feet. But
she rallied on her thirty and took the ball away
by a carefully measured two inches and started
back again. She could not afford to risk anything
now and so it was a case of hit the line and hold
the ball. And she did hit it! Moore had to give
up, but the eager substitute who took his place made
good. Farnsworth still pegged away, as mighty as
ever, although when play stopped for a moment he
could hardly stand up and Tinker was watching
him frowningly from the side of the field. Ted
had more chances and played them through, gaining
more often than not. But he, too, was almost
gone it seemed, and Larry was considerate for what
he had already done.</p>

<p>The shadows lengthened and the game drew to
its end. Fairfield was still cheering on the stands,
still hopeful on the field. A misjudged punt
brought a groan of dismay from the Staunton adherents
and gave the enemy her opportunity to
pull the game from the fire. It was Stirling, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
substitute left half, who erred, and of a sudden
the enemy was pounding at the Staunton gate.
From the twenty-six yards to the fifteen she fought
her way in the four downs. There, unwisely, perhaps,
scorning a field goal, she raced against the
clicking seconds of the timekeeper’s watch and
plunged on toward a touchdown. Two yards—three—one—and
there were but four to go, with
Staunton digging her cleats into the torn turf of the
last defense.</p>

<p>The enemy staged a try-at-goal, but Staunton
refused to believe in it, and, as it was proved,
rightly. For the ball went back to a half instead
of the kicker and he sped off toward the left and
the line broke and followed him. His run started
near the twenty yards and he ran in to the fifteen
before he began to circle. By that time the interference
was solid about him and when he turned
in it seemed that sheer weight of numbers would
carry the ball over. The Staunton defenders went
down battling gamely, the rush slowed but kept
moving. <a href="#i_fp152">Somewhere in that mêlée was the runner
with the precious ball</a> hugged tightly to his body.
They were pushing past the ten-yard line now.
Cries of exhortation, of despair and of triumph<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
arose above the panting and gasping and the thud
of bodies. To the eight yards—to the seven——.</p>

    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_153">SOMEWHERE IN THAT MÊLÉE WAS THE RUNNER WITH THE
PRECIOUS BALL</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>A brown-legged player picked himself from the
turf with distorted face and plunged at the struggling
mass. Somehow he penetrated it and was
swallowed from sight. And then, wonder of
wonders, the forward movement stopped, the mass
swayed, gave before the desperate force of the
defenders and moved back. From somewhere a
faint gasp of “<em>Down!</em>” was heard. But already the
whistle had blown.</p>

<p>The ball was found just past the six yards.
Above it lay a grim-faced Fairfield half-back and
above him, one arm, the right, wrapped tenaciously
about his knees, lay Ted. And, although they had
to fairly pry that arm and its clutching fingers loose,
Ted knew nothing about it, for he had fainted
again!</p>

<p>The home team rushed once, kicked out of
danger and the game was over and the crowds
overflowed the field, Staunton cheering ecstatically
and wildly as she sought to capture her players.
But Ted, over by the bench, knew very little of
that. He felt Tinker’s tenderly cruel fingers exploring
his left shoulder and he groaned. He didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
mean to, but he couldn’t help it. And he heard
Thornton ask solicitously: “Break, Tink?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Shoulder blade. A nice clean break, too.
He did it when they tackled him down near their
goal that time. He wouldn’t let on and he had
me fooled till I noticed a few minutes ago that he
wasn’t using his left arm much!”</p>

<p>“Hm!” said the coach.</p>

<p>“And that ain’t all of it either,” continued the
trainer, his fingers still at work. “It feels to me
like he’d had trouble there before. There’s a sort
of lump—All right, lad, I won’t hurt you any more.
You’re a plucky little divil! I’ll say that for you!”</p>

<p>And last of all Ted heard Jack Groom’s voice
from a great distance: “And that’s the fellow you
said was a quitter!”</p>

<p>Then, following that beastly habit of his, Ted
fainted again!</p>

a wrench in his hand and, lifting the hood,
began to inspect the spark plugs.</p>

<p>He was a healthy, well-built, intelligent-looking

Clear gray eyes, a straight nose, a mouth that

<p>Tom’s father had proposed calling the car “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">E
Pluribus Unum</i>,” since it was decidedly one out
of many! Tom had built it himself; he had got
the parts at secondhand—here, there and anywhere.
The small, two-cylinder, twelve-horse-power engine
that supplied the motive power Tom had picked
up for a song at a repair shop in Kingston. The
body he had built himself, and the engine hood
he had had made at the local stamping works. You
would never have suspected that under the two
coats of brilliant red paint the hood was nothing
more than a fair quality of zinc!</p>

<p>The car was air-cooled and chain-driven, and
when Tom drove it over rough roads it rattled like
half a dozen dish pans. But for all that it could
do its thirty miles an hour, and perhaps better were
it permitted to! Tom had spent most of his spare
time that spring in building the car; but he had had
a great deal of pleasure, to say nothing of his final
triumph when he made his first trip through Kingston,
to the confusion of the scoffers who had predicted
failure!</p>

<p>But Puff had its troubles, just as larger and more
expensive cars have theirs, and so far that summer
much of its life had been spent in the stable, undergoing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
repairs. If the truth were told, however,
Tom got almost as much pleasure out of Puff in
the stable as he did out of Puff on the road, for
he was never happier than when he was tinkering
with machinery.</p>

<p>This morning he had overhauled the little car
with more than ordinary care, for he was to make
the run to Bristol and back, a matter of forty-eight
miles all told. The trip was in the nature of a
supreme test of Puff’s endurance. All had gone
well until Kingston lay two miles behind. Then
Puff had begun to skip and lose power, and Tom
had at last been forced to investigate.</p>

<p>The investigation, however, was not very successful;
both spark plugs were bright and appeared
to be firing perfectly. With a puzzled shake of his
head, Tom replaced them and began to survey the
wiring. It was at this moment that a sound up the
road toward home drew his attention. He had
barely time to raise his head and look before a huge
touring car raced past him in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>Yet it did not travel so fast that Tom failed to
identify the make. It was a Spalding of the latest
model—a big, six-cylinder car painted battleship
gray, with bright red wheels. In the big tonneau<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
sat a single passenger, a man in a light gray overcoat
and a cloth cap. The chauffeur was in brown
livery. All this Tom saw before the car was lost
to sight round a bend in the road. It did not, he
was sure, belong in Kingston, for there was only
one six-cylinder automobile in the town, and that
was a Wright. Probably the car belonged in
Bristol, for the Spalding factory was in that city.
It was doubtless returning from a trip to Kingston,
he concluded.</p>

<p>He started his engine again and climbed back
to the seat. Puff started off well, and Tom was
congratulating himself on having unwittingly repaired
the trouble, when again the engine began to
miss fire. It seemed very puzzling. His errand
made it necessary for him to reach Bristol before
the bank closed at twelve, and so he did not dare
to spend too much time on the road. As long as
Puff made its twenty miles an hour—and it was
doing that and more, as the small speedometer
showed—he decided that he would keep on. After
he had delivered the envelope that was in his pocket
at the bank and thus done his father’s errand, he
would look for the trouble.</p>

<p>“If I can’t find it,” he said to himself with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
smile, “maybe I’ll drop round to the Spalding factory
and exchange Puff for one of those ‘six-sixties’!
Only,” he added half aloud as he swung
round the turn, “they’ll have to give me something
to boot!”</p>

<p>The next instant he was staring ahead with interest.
Beyond, drawn up at the side of the road,
stood the big car. The chauffeur was leaning under
the raised hood and the passenger was watching
from the car. As Tom approached he slowed Puff
down a little. He would have been less than human
had he not experienced an instant of mild satisfaction.
Puff had cost him something like eighty
dollars, whereas the big Spalding, as Tom well
knew, was priced at nearly four thousand dollars;
and certainly, as far as the quality of “get there”
was concerned, the big car was at that moment
inferior to the little one.</p>

<p>As Tom approached, he noticed that the man in
the gray overcoat looked cross and irritated, and
that the chauffeur was worried. It seemed rather
ridiculous for him to offer assistance, he reflected,
but, nevertheless, he stopped. “I don’t suppose I
can be of any help, sir?” he inquired.</p>

<p>The man in the car shook his head impatiently,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
with only a glance toward him; but the chauffeur,
casting a quick and wondering look over the small
car and wiping his hands upon a bunch of waste,
replied sarcastically, “Not unless you’ve got a spare
cylinder.”</p>

<p>“What!” cried the man in the car. “Cylinder
gone?”</p>

<p>“Piston’s broken, sir. Thought maybe it was
only the valve was stuck or something, but I guess
it’s the piston, all right.”</p>

<p>“But jumping cats!” snapped the man in the gray
coat. “You can’t mend a broken piston rod!”</p>

<p>“No sir.”</p>

<p>“And she won’t run?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not to speak of. She’s pushing the
charge back into the carburetor. We might limp
along about ten miles an hour, Mr. Fletcher, but
I shouldn’t like to say that we’d not spoil another
cylinder.”</p>

<p>“But I’ve got to get back by eleven! Can we
get another car round here?”</p>

<p>“There’s a garage at Kingston, sir. Maybe——”</p>

<p>“How far back is it?”</p>

<p>“A matter of three miles, I guess.”</p>

<p>“About two and a half,” Tom corrected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>The passenger looked at his watch and frowned
impatiently.</p>

<p>“I suppose it would take half an hour to get it,”
he said. “It’s 10.18 now and my train leaves at
11.04. There’s less than an hour, and I’ve got to
get that train to Chicago. Look here!” He swung
round toward Tom. “Will that thing you’ve got
there run?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Tom a little coldly. He
did not like to have Puff called a “thing”!</p>

<p>“Will, eh?” snapped the man. “Well, there’s
fifty dollars in it if you’ll get me to Bristol in
time for the 11.04 express. Can you do it?”</p>

<p>Tom shook his head. “No, sir. If it’s 10.18
now, there’s only forty-six minutes and the distance
is twenty-two miles. This car can do thirty on
good roads, but——”</p>

<p>“Tut! tut! tut! Any car that can do thirty can
do thirty-five if you push it. I tell you I’ll give
you fifty dollars if you get me there. Isn’t that
enough?”</p>

<p>“Plenty, thanks,” replied Tom quietly. “But I’m
not running very well to-day. Something wrong
with my plugs, I guess; or maybe it’s the wiring.
Anyway——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>But Mr. Fletcher was already climbing out of
his car. “Dennis!” he said sharply. “Bring some
spare spark plugs!”</p>

<p>He was across the road in a second. “Get your
plugs out,” he ordered Tom, “and see if mine will
fit. Get a move on, if you want to earn that fifty.”</p>

<p>Tom hesitated for an instant. Then he said, “I’ll
do the best I can, sir.”</p>

<p>By the time the chauffeur had found the new
plugs Tom had taken the old ones out. Fortunately,
the new ones fitted and the chauffeur quickly
screwed them in. As Tom connected the wires, Mr.
Fletcher issued directions to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>“Get my bag, Dennis. Put it between my feet
here. You stay with the car and I’ll send out and
have you towed home. Put it in the shop and tell
Morrison to give you something to use while it’s
being fixed. Meet the 4.10 to-morrow afternoon.
All right, son! Now let’s see what you can do.”
He pulled his watch out again. “You’ve got forty-four
minutes!”</p>

<p>Tom started the engine, sprang to the seat, threw
in the clutch, changed to high speed and bounded
gayly off. The seat was narrow and low, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
Mr. Fletcher, who was of ordinary height and
stockily built, filled his half of it to overflowing.</p>

<p>“Most uncomfortable seat I was ever in!” he
exclaimed. “What make of a car is this, for goodness’
sake?”</p>

<p>“Burrill, two-twelve, Model A,” replied Tom
gravely, clinging to the wheel as the car swung
round the next bend in the road.</p>

<p>“Never heard of it,” said the other. “Won’t it
go any faster than this?”</p>

<p>The hand on the speedometer was hovering back
and forth round thirty. Tom drew the throttle
down another notch and the hand went to thirty-three.
The new spark plugs had evidently done the
work, for there was never a skip now. Puff was
running as smoothly as a Spalding Six!</p>

<p>“That’s better!” grunted the passenger, holding
on tight to keep from being jounced out. “If the
thing sticks together we may make it. How much
do they get for these things?”</p>

<p>“It cost me about eighty dollars,” answered Tom,
tooting his horn frantically as he saw a wagon
ahead.</p>

<p>“Oh, second-hand, eh?”</p>

<p>“Most of it, sir. I made it myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>“Made it yourself!” There was both surprise
and admiration in Mr. Fletcher’s tone. “Well,
you’re a mechanic, my boy. I’ll apologize for any
disparaging remarks I may have made. Sorry if
I hurt your feelings.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied Tom, as he swung
almost into the ditch to get round the wagon, the
driver of which was fast asleep on the seat. “It isn’t
much of a car, but it does pretty well. And I
haven’t broken any pistons yet!”</p>

<p>“Hum!” said Mr. Fletcher. “Well, send her
along, son. If she’ll keep this up we may make it.
By Jove, we’ve got to make it! I wouldn’t miss
that appointment in Chicago for a thousand dollars!
Let her out another notch. You’ve got a
straight road.”</p>

<p>But Tom shook his head. “I’d rather not. We
can make it this way if nothing happens.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fletcher grunted. The little car was going
at its best speed; to Tom, who was clutching the
wheel with strained muscles and intently watching
the road ahead, it seemed to leap past the fences
as if it were alive.</p>

<p>“So you made this yourself?” Mr. Fletcher said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
presently. “Must have been something of a job.
I’ve made a few myself, but——”</p>

<p>There was a sharp <em>crack</em>! Mr. Fletcher’s side
of the car suddenly sank, and he grabbed wildly
at Tom in an effort to keep his balance. As Tom
set the emergency brake, the car swerved and came
to a stop. Tom leaped out and viewed the damage.</p>

<p>“Spring’s busted,” he reported. “I always
thought they were too light.”</p>

<p>“Spring, eh? Well, she’ll run, won’t she?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but it’s going to be uncomfortable,
because the body’s right down on the axle on your
side.”</p>

<p>“H’m, I guess a little more discomfort won’t
matter! Let’s get on, let’s get on!”</p>

<p>They went on, with the speedometer wavering
round thirty-three miles an hour. Twice Tom had
to slow down: once when the road dipped and
turned sharply under a railway bridge, and again
when they passed through the little village of West
Adams. At intervals Mr. Fletcher, carefully releasing
his hold on the car, took out his watch and
reported the time.</p>

<p>“Ten thirty-eight,” he said, as they speeded up
again beyond West Adams. “How much farther?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>“About twelve miles. We’ll do it if——”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to do it!”</p>

<p>A few minutes later Mr. Fletcher sniffed the air.
“She’s heating up, isn’t she? Got water in your
radiator?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; she’s air-cooled.”</p>

<p>“Smells like it!”</p>

<p>A long hill rose in front, and Tom pulled down
his throttle another notch or two. Puff took the
hill flying, and Mr. Fletcher grunted in unwilling
admiration.</p>

<p>“Lots of power! What’s that?”</p>

<p>A dull pounding noise was coming from under
the car.</p>

<p>“Flat tire,” said Tom. “We’ll have to run on
the rim.”</p>

<p>“Ten forty-seven!” Mr. Fletcher announced.
“Can we do it?”</p>

<p>“If she’ll hold together! It’s only about six
miles, I think.”</p>

<p>“When you get this side of town, where the
two roads branch at the powder factory, take the
right. It’s a poor road, but it’s a mile shorter and
goes straight to the station.”</p>

<p><em>Bumpity-bump!</em> went the body against the axle!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
<em>Thumpity-thump!</em> went the wheel with the flat tire.
<em>Honk! honk!</em> went the horn. The little car tore
along. Five minutes later the smoke pall above
Bristol was in sight. The road grew rougher and
wagons began to dispute the way. At the powder
factory Tom swung to the right on a road that
was rutted by heavy teaming.</p>

<p>“Just fifty-seven!” shouted Mr. Fletcher above
the noise.</p>

<p>Tom nodded. Ahead of them the city, with its
tall chimneys belching smoke, was now in plain
sight. Puff jumped and careened, but kept its pace.
Three miles more and seven minutes left!</p>

<p>Suddenly an exclamation of dismay from his
companion sent Tom’s gaze traveling far up the
road. A quarter of a mile ahead a drawbridge
spanned a river, and approaching it from downstream
was a tugboat. Even as Tom looked little
puffs of gray steam rose from the tug, and an instant
later the whistle blasts from it reached him.
She was signaling for the draw; the tender already
had begun to swing the gates.</p>

<p>“That settles it!” groaned Mr. Fletcher.</p>

<p>Tom calculated the distance, pulled down the
throttle, and Puff sprang madly forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>“Reach past me and blow the horn!” Tom
gasped.</p>

<p>Mr. Fletcher obeyed. <em>Honk! honk! honk!</em>
shrieked the little car. The bridge tender had
closed one of the two gates on the farther side
and was hurrying toward the other. <em>Honk! honk!
honk!</em> Then he heard, paused, looked from car to
tugboat and, raising a hand, warned them back.</p>

<p>But Tom never hesitated. On rushed the car.
The bridge was only a hundred feet away now,
and Mr. Fletcher shouting unintelligible words, was
working the horn madly. <a href="#i_fp168">The bridge tender had
half closed the second gate</a>, when he changed his
mind and hastily swung it open. There was a roar
of planks under flying wheels, a swerve, the sound
of a rear hub glancing from the end of the closed
gate, and they were over. Behind them a wrathful
tender shook his fist in the air!</p>

    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_169">THE BRIDGE TENDER HAD HALF CLOSED THE SECOND GATE</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“Three minutes past!” gasped Mr. Fletcher.</p>

<p>But the station was in sight, beside the platform
stood the long express. Still honking wildly, Puff
dashed through the slow-moving traffic and pulled
up with a jerk at the platform. Waving at the
engineer, Mr. Fletcher tumbled out.</p>

<p>“Bag!” he cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p>Tom pushed it across with one foot.</p>

<p>“Thanks! I’ll have to send—that fifty. What’s—the
name?”</p>

<p>“Tom Burrill, sir, but I don’t want any money.”</p>

<p>“All abo-o-oard!” called the conductor.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Tom Burrill? Live in Kingston?
You’ll hear from me—day or two! By!”</p>

<p>Mr. Fletcher rushed away, and was half pushed
up the steps of a parlor car as the train moved off.
Ten minutes later, at the bank, Tom put a question
to the man at the window:</p>

<p>“Is there a Mr. Fletcher who lives here in Bristol,
sir?”</p>

<p>“Fletcher? Certainly. Mr. Henry L. Fletcher
lives here.”</p>

<p>“And—and what does he do, please?”</p>

<p>“Do? Why, makes automobiles, of course!
haven’t you ever heard of the Spalding car?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” murmured Tom.</p>

<p>“Made right here in Bristol. A fine car, my
boy.”</p>

<p>“Not bad,” replied Tom carelessly as he turned
away. “Weak in the cylinders, though.”</p>

<p>Four days later at breakfast Tom received a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
letter in an envelope that bore the words, “Spalding
Automobile Company, Bristol.”</p>

<p>The inclosure was brief. He read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: We are instructed by the President, Mr. Henry
L. Fletcher, to deliver to you or your order one of our

<p>“And what,” inquired Tom’s father a little later,
“will you call this new automobile of yours? E

<p>Tom did not hesitate. “I guess,” said he loyally,
“I’ll call it Puff the Second.”</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">Joe Talmadge came to Hollins from some
fresh-water college out in Wisconsin. Anyway,
they called it a college, but Joe had
hard work getting into the upper middle class at
Hollins, and Hollins is only a prep school, so it
seems that his college, which was called Eureka or
Excelsior or something like that, couldn’t have
ranked with Yale or Princeton. His father had
died the spring before. He had been in the lumber
business in a place called Green Bay and had made
a pile of money, I guess. They had opened an office
or agency or something in Philadelphia a year or
so before and when Mr. Talmadge died the other
men in the company decided that Joe was to finish
getting an education right away and take charge
of the Philadelphia end of the business. It was
Joe’s idea to finish up somewhere in the East, because,
as he said, folks back East were different
and he’d ought to learn their ways. That’s how he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
came to duck his Excelsior place and come to
Hollins.</p>

<p>The first time I saw him was the evening of the
day before the Fall term began. They’d made me
proctor on the third floor of Hyde Hall and after
supper that night I was unpacking in number forty-three
when I heard a beast of a rumpus down the
corridor and hiked out to see what was doing. It
seemed that they’d put Joe in thirty-seven with a
fellow named Prentice, who hails from Detroit.
Prentice was all right except that his dad had made
money too quickly. He had invented a patent brake
lining or something for automobiles and everyone
wanted it and he had made a pile of money in
about six years and it had sort of gone to Tom
Prentice’s head. He wasn’t a bad sort, Tom wasn’t,
but he could be beastly offensive if he set out to.
When I knocked at thirty-seven no one inside heard
me because there was too much noise. So I just
walked in. The study table was lying on its side
and the gas drop light—we didn’t have electricity
in Hyde then—was dangling a couple of inches
from the floor at the end of its green tube. Tom
Prentice was lying on his neck on one of the beds
with his heels near the ceiling and Joe was standing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
over him waiting for him to come back to earth.
Joe didn’t look mad, but he looked mighty earnest.</p>

<p>He was seventeen, but big for his years, wide-shouldered
and powerful looking. He had a nice
sort of face, with gray eyes and very dark hair
and a good deal of sunburn. His hair needed trimming
and some of it was dangling down over his
forehead, making him look sort of desperate, and
I wondered what would happen to me if I had to
step in between them. But I didn’t. Joe stopped
knocking Tom around for a minute and I explained
that I was proctor and accountable for the peace
and quiet of that floor. By that time Tom was
sitting on the bed looking dazed and holding one
hand to his jaw. I never did find out what had
actually started the riot, but it was something that
Tom had said about the sovereign State of Wisconsin,
I think. I persuaded them to shake hands
and forget it and Tom said he hadn’t meant whatever
it was just the way Joe had taken it, and when
I went out Joe was fussing around Tom with arnica
and wet towels.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They got on all right together after that first
show-down. Maybe Tom realized that he was no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
match for Joe. Tom wasn’t any frail lad, either.
He weighed about a hundred and sixty and was
eighteen years old and played left guard on the
Eleven. It was Tom who induced Joe to go out
for football. Joe had played a little out West, but
had never taken it seriously, and didn’t show any
enthusiasm for it now, only Tom kept at him, I
guess. Anyway, I saw Joe working with the dubs
a day or two after the term began. They had him
going through the motions at center on the fourth
or fifth scrub. I remember saying to Larry Keets,
who was assistant manager that Fall, that “that guy
Talmadge was built for the part, all right.” Keets
looked across and grinned.</p>

<p>“Yeah, he’s built for it, maybe, but he handles
the ball like it was a basket of eggs. Morgan”—Morgan
was our coach—“was eying him yesterday,
but he’s still where he is. Anyway, we’ve got centers
and guards and tackles to burn. It’s back field
men we need, Zach, and a couple of good ends.”</p>

<p>Which was all true. We’d lost seven out of the
fifteen men who had played in the big game last
Fall, and all but two were backs. Of the two, one
was an end and the other was a guard. Coach
Morgan and Truitt, our right tackle and captain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
were raking the whole school for halfback material
and not having much success in finding any.</p>

<p>I ought to say here that Hollins had been having
a run of perfectly rotten luck for four years. Enwright
Academy was our big rival and Enwright
had beaten us three times and played us to a scoreless
tie once in those four years. It had got so that
a win over the blue and gold was something mythical,
like the dodo or the dope about Hercules and
the Nemean lion. No one in school when I was
there had ever seen Hollins beat Enwright at football
and we’d got so that we’d stopped hoping, or
at least expecting, anything like that to happen.
And along about the middle of October, by which
time we had been licked three times, we had resigned
ourselves to the regular programme: mass
meetings, secret practice, plenty of cheering, bluffing
to the last minute and—defeat.</p>

<p>We played a ten game schedule that year. The
week before the Enwright game we had Gloversville
coming back for a return engagement, Gloversville
being calculated to give us good practice and no
risk of injuries to our players.</p>

<p>About the last week in October I got a surprise.
I went down to the field one Thursday afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
with a couple of the fellows to watch practice. Morgan
had started secret sessions, but to-day they had
opened the gates. There had been several cuts in
the squad by that time and only the first and second
teams were left; perhaps thirty-four or five
fellows in all. They were scrimmaging when we
got there and the second was trying to get over the
first’s goal line from the fifteen yards. They made
two tries, wide end runs both of them, and didn’t
gain an inch, but after each play I noticed that one
of the second team men had to trot back about
twenty yards to get into position again. Whoever
he was, he had just romped through the first’s line
and was behind the goal posts each time. Then,
when we had got over opposite the play, I saw that
it was Joe Talmadge. On the next down the second’s
quarter fumbled and after the ball had rolled
around awhile the second team’s full-back fell on
it. It seemed to me that almost any one of the
first team forwards should have broken through and
got that pigskin, but they didn’t, and it dawned on
me that the reason they didn’t was just because
the second’s center had been too stiff for them.
After the second had tried a place kick and failed,
the ball went back to mid-field, and during the next<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
seven or eight minutes of that scrimmage I watched
Joe closely. And what I saw made me wonder if
Coach Morgan had lost his eyesight, for Joe simply
played Pride to a standstill. Not once did the first
make a gain anywhere near the middle of the second
team’s line, and when the second finally got
the pigskin again, after Stringer had made a mess
of a run around left end, it was always Joe who
led the way through. He would just spin Pride
around like a top, or push him back like he was a
straw man, and romp past him. But why Morgan
didn’t see it was more than I could figure out, and
that evening, after commons, I tackled Captain
Truitt. Tru and I were pretty good friends, for I
had got him into Arcanium the year before.</p>

<p>“Talmadge?” he said thoughtfully. “Yes, I
know, Zach. He’s been putting up a corking game
on the second right along for two weeks, but when
we try him on the first he falls down flat. We’ve
had him over twice. The first time we thought it
was stage fright, but he was just as bad the next.
Sometimes fellows are like that. They’ll work like
Trojans for the scrubs and be no earthly good on
the first. Coach hauled him over the coals last week
about it and all Talmadge could say was that ‘he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
didn’t know.’ Too bad, for he’d come mighty near
to making trouble for Enwright.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t sound like sense to me,” I said. “If
he can play like a whirlwind on one team why can’t
he do it on another.”</p>

<p>“Search me,” said Tru, “but some fellows are like
that. Coach talks of trying him again Saturday
against Wooster High. I don’t know if he will,
though, for we can’t afford to take any chances.
I’d like mighty well,” he added bitterly, “to win
one more game this season.”</p>

<p>“One!” said I. “Oh, run away, Tru! The
trouble with you chaps is that you’ve lost faith in
yourselves. You’re so used to getting the short end
of it that you can’t believe in winning. Buck up!”</p>

<p>“That’s a fact, old man! I believe you’re dead
right. We’re so used to being rotten that we don’t
know how to be anything else. What we need is
one of these psychology sharks to come around and
sort of hypnotize us into a new state of mind.
Short of that, Zach, we’ll do the same old stunt
again.”</p>

<p>“Psychology, your grandmother! Use your
beans! Why shouldn’t we win from Enwright?
What’s to prevent? Why——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>“Nothing, except that they’ve got the best team
they’ve had in three years and we’ve got a worse
one than we had last year. And last year they beat
us by seventeen——”</p>

<p>“Sure! I know! You needn’t go into the sickening
details. But it’s idiotic to think that you’re
bound to be licked, Tru. I’m not much on the
psychology stuff, but I do think that there’s a whole
lot in believing that you’re going to get what you
want. Why not try it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I do. That is, I try to. I don’t talk this
way to the fellows, Zach. You’re different. You
don’t talk. And it’s a relief to be gloomy once in
awhile. On the field I have to be ‘Little Sunshine’
until my mouth aches from grinning.”</p>

<p>“Well, for the love of lemons don’t quit yet,
Tru. Keep a stiff upper lip and maybe you’ll pull
off a miracle.”</p>

<p>Whether Joe Talmadge got onto the first or not
was no affair of mine, but I sort of liked the chap,
what little I’d seen of him, and, besides, it looked
to me as if the team ought to go up against Enwright
with the best players to be found. Anyway,
I munched it over going across the yard, and when
I got to the third floor of Hyde I stopped at thirty-seven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
and knocked. Someone said “Come in,” and
I opened the door. Joe was alone. Tom, he said,
hadn’t come back from supper, and would I wait?
I had meant to ask Tom if there wasn’t some way
of getting Joe to put up a fight when they got him
on the first, thinking that maybe he could talk it
over with his roommate and find out what the
trouble was. I certainly hadn’t intended talking to
Joe himself about it, but that’s just what I found
myself doing a few minutes later. Joe was a nice
sort and he kind of made you say what you had
on your mind. Maybe he had what they call magnetism.
Anyway, there I was pretty soon talking
it over with him, he lolling back on the window
seat, hugging his long legs and looking thoughtful.</p>

<p>“You’ve got me, Morris,” he said finally.
“They’re dead right about it, too. Some way, when
they stick me in there on the first I sort o’ lose
my pep. I don’t know why. Say, do you believe
in—in——”</p>

<p>He stopped and I said “Fairies?”</p>

<p>“No, but atmosphere.”</p>

<p>“Sure, Talmadge! I’m a firm believer in it,”
said I earnestly, not knowing what he was driving
at.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<p>“Honest?” He seemed pleased and I was glad
I’d said the right thing. “Well, sometimes I think
it’s atmosphere that does it.”</p>

<p>“Does what?” I asked, puzzled.</p>

<p>“Why, makes me play so dog-gone punk on the
first,” he explained gravely. “I’ll tell you, Morris,”
he dropped his knees and thrust his big hands into
his trousers pockets, “when I’m playing on the second
I—I kind of feel like I was doing something
that wanted to be done. I feel like the fellows
around me wanted to win the scrimmage. But
when they put me over in the other line I don’t get
that—that feeling at all. I suppose that sounds
like silly stuff to you, but——”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” I said. “It doesn’t, Talmadge. I believe
you’ve found the answer. I believe you’ve
put your thumb right on the—the tack! That’s just
what you would feel on the first, I’ll bet. Those
chumps have been licked so often they don’t believe
in themselves any more.”</p>

<p>“That it? Well, that’s the way I feel, and I don’t
seem to be able to get rid of it. I guess that coach
thinks I’m an awful dub, but I can’t help it. I try
hard enough, but the—whatdoyoucallit—incentive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
isn’t there. Or something. Atmosphere I’ve called
it. Or feeling. Something.”</p>

<p>We talked it over quite a bit. I thought he was
right about the trouble, and I still think so. I got
him finally to promise to make a good hard bid
the next time. “Just try your best to forget the
atmosphere,” said I. “Play your own game, Talmadge.
Make up your mind that, no matter
whether the rest of the team want to win or get
licked, you yourself are dead set on winning. Will
you do it?”</p>

<p>“Sure! Much obliged. It’s good of you to—to
bother.” He insisted on shaking hands. “If he
lets me in Saturday I’ll do the best I can. Maybe
it won’t be much, though. After all, I don’t know
an awful lot about football. Just the rudiments.
But I’ll see if I can’t—” he hesitated, smiled and
went on—“can’t create my own atmosphere.”</p>

<p>I had planned to go home Saturday after dinner,
but I stayed around and saw the game and took
the five-twelve instead. I wish I hadn’t, for we
got most unmercifully beaten by Wooster. To be
sure, Wooster had every bit of luck there was, but
even taking that into consideration our fellows
played a pretty punk game. The big disappointment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
to me was Joe. Morgan put him in at the
start and let him finish the quarter, but he didn’t
put up any sort of a fight. And I could see that
he was trying, too. Wooster broke up our center
time and again, and the only reason Morgan let
Joe stay in was because the play was all in mid-field
and I guess he kept on hoping that Joe would
find himself. I came across him between the halves.
He had dressed and was looking on from the side
line. When he saw me he smiled wryly and shook
his head.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” he said. “But it wasn’t any use,
Morris. I’m kiboshed, I guess. They smeared me
for fair, didn’t they?”</p>

<p>I nodded. “But what was the trouble?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. The same, I guess. I tried to
make believe that the whole thing depended on me
and that I was the main squeeze, but it didn’t seem
to work. Say, do the rest of those fellows really
<em>want</em> to win, or—or what?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, they do, of course,” said I. “But—maybe
they don’t know it!”</p>

<p>Joe sighed. “Something’s wrong with them. I
had the impression all the time that I was taking
a lot of trouble for nothing, that no one cared what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
happened, and it balled me all up. I’m going to
quit football, I guess. Anyhow, I ain’t got time
for it.”</p>

<p>I said something polite and beat it back to the
stand. It didn’t seem to me to make much difference
whether he quit or not.</p>

<p>Things ambled along toward the second Gloversville
game. I noticed that Joe was still playing on
the second, and gathered from something Tom said
that he had wanted to quit and had been overruled
by the coaches.</p>

<p>We licked Gloversville thirteen to six, in a glorified
practice game in which every substitute had a
chance to show his gait. And after that we settled
down for the final humiliation of being whipped to
a froth by Enwright the following Saturday.
Honestly, you couldn’t find ten fellows in school
who would say that Hollins was going to win, and
you couldn’t have found one who believed it! I
didn’t. I’ll say that frankly.</p>

<p>Three of the second team were taken over to the
first, and Joe was one of them. Maybe Morgan
thought he might need a third center if Enwright
played the sort of game she was expected to. Anyway,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
Joe was huddled up on the bench with the
rest of the subs when the game started.</p>

<p>It was a cloudy, still November day, with a touch
of frost in the air, and there was no choice between
goals. We won the toss and gave the ball to Enwright.
The visitors were a husky lot, all right.
They’d won six out of nine games and hadn’t any
doubt about winning another to-day. They were a
rangy, powerful bunch, and looked fast and keen.
As to weight they had it over us by a few pounds
in the average, but not enough to worry about. We
weren’t worrying about anything, for that matter.
We had made up our minds to fight hard and die
fighting. Only, we expected to die. And anybody
knows that that’s no way to go into a football
game. We believed that Fate had everything all
doped out for us, so what was the use of worrying?
I heard afterwards that Morgan fairly insulted
them in the dressing room before the game,
but he didn’t get any reaction. They refused to be
insulted. They were dogged, but there wasn’t
enough vanity in the whole bunch to fit out a Pomeranian
lap dog. Then they went out and trotted
onto the gridiron, while we waved and cheered them
nobly, prepared to die like heroes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>They had an awful surprise in the first ten minutes
of that period. Enwright absolutely refused
to play football. Whether she was a bit stale or
what the trouble was I don’t know, but she fumbled
and ran wild and misjudged punts and acted like
a bunch of grammar school kids. You could have
heard their quarter raving at them as far away as
the laboratory, I guess. The first thing anyone
knew Hollins had pushed White over for a touchdown
and Tru had kicked a pretty goal!</p>

<p>Oh boy! Maybe we didn’t go crazy on the stand!
Why, we hadn’t done anything like that to Enwright
in four years! We got cocky and crazy-headed
and predicted a score something like
twenty-eight to nothing! We ought to have known
better, but we didn’t. Enwright sort of pulled herself
together after that and held us off until the
quarter was up. But we were still hopeful and
looked for more glory in the second period. The
glory was there, too, but it went to Enwright. She
came bravely out of her trance and pushed us
straight down the field for a touchdown and then,
when White misjudged a long corkscrew punt and
had to fall on the ball on our twelve yards, she
did it again in just three rushes. She missed both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
goals, though, and we got some comfort from that.
Twelve to seven wasn’t so bad, after all. And the
game wasn’t half over yet.</p>

<p>But, although the visitors didn’t score again in
that quarter, they outplayed us badly. And they
kept it up in the third period, too, after we had
sung and cheered all during half-time. But they
didn’t score. They had three perfectly good
chances, and each time some turn of the luck
queered them. Of course, our fellows did their bit.
They were giving their well-known imitation of
Horatius keeping the bridge. But, shucks, if it
hadn’t been for a fumble on our three yards, a perfectly
punk pass from center to fullback and holding
in the line, Enwright would have scored three
times in that quarter. The trouble with us was
that we never forgot who we were up against. We
were whatyoucallems—fatalists. When an Enwright
runner was tackled he kept on running and
made another yard, maybe two or three. When one
of our fellows was tackled he quit cold. Same way
in hitting the line. When one of our backs ran up
against the defense he eased up. Even our punting
showed it. We didn’t mean to quit, but we were
doing it. We oozed through the third quarter with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
the score still twelve to seven, and we began to hope
then that we could hold the score where it was.
What happened after the whistle blew I got from
Tru and Joe.</p>

<p>Coach Morgan called Joe from the bench. “Jones
is very bad,” he said in that quiet, crisp way of his,
“and they’re making too many gains at our center,
Talmadge. It’s too bad we haven’t anyone to stiffen
it, isn’t it? If it was only the second team I’d
chance putting you in.”</p>

<p>Joe looked troubled. “I’ll try my best, sir,” he
said doubtfully.</p>

<p>“We-ell, I don’t know. They’ve got us beaten
anyway, and——”</p>

<p>Joe flared up. “<em>They</em> have! Like fun they have!
We’ve got ourselves beaten. There isn’t a fellow
out there that doesn’t think he’s done for right now.
There isn’t one of ’em that really <em>expects</em> to win.
There isn’t more than one or two that’s <em>trying</em>.
They’re just dying game, that’s all they’re doing!
Beaten! Yah, that Enwright bunch would quit cold
if someone put up a real fight!”</p>

<p>“Think so?” asked the coach mildly. “I wonder.
Too bad someone couldn’t go out there and convince
them of that, isn’t it, Talmadge?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, but what’s the use? They won’t believe it,
Coach.”</p>

<p>“They might—if it was put to them hard
enough,” the man mused.</p>

<p>Joe began to pull up his sweater sort of half-heartedly.</p>

<p>“If <em>you</em> think that way, Talmadge, you might get
the others to. You might try it. It wouldn’t do
any harm. We’re beaten anyway, and——”</p>

<p>“That ain’t so!” cried Joe angrily. “You know it,
too!”</p>

<p>“What good does my knowing it do?” asked
Morgan gently.</p>

<p>Joe pulled his sweater over his head and flung it
behind him.</p>

<p>“Jones?” he asked.</p>

<p>The coach nodded. “And tell Truitt I said I’d
changed my plans. Tell him I’ve decided to win
the game.”</p>

<p>Joe grinned. Then he ran on just in time and
pushed Jones out of the way.</p>

<p>It was Enwright’s ball on her forty-six yards,
second down and five to go when Joe arrived. Tru
looked a bit puzzled at the message for a moment,
but then he grasped the idea and it seemed to do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
him a lot of good. “That’s the stuff!” he cried
hoarsely. “We’ve got orders from the coach to
win this, fellows! What d’ye say now! Everyone
into it hard! All we want’s one score. Let’s
get it!”</p>

<p>Enwright tried out the new center and made only
a yard. Joe jeered at them. “Come again!” he
told them. “Always glad to see you!” They got
three past left tackle and Joe was on Conners like
a ton of bricks, bawling him out. “What do you
think you’re doing?” he demanded. “Trying to
chuck this game away? Fight, you big baby! Don’t
let ’em walk over you! <em>Fight!</em>”</p>

<p>Conners was so surprised that he forgot to get
mad until it was too late. Tru said that having
Joe butt in and take things out of his hands like
that sort of flabbergasted him, but he was so tired
and used up he was glad to have someone else do
the bossing. Enwright only needed another yard
to make her distance and she tried to shove her way
past Conners for it. But Conners was insulted and
mad clean through now, and he wouldn’t have it,
and blamed if we didn’t take the ball away from
them in the middle of the field, and for the first
time that day!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>After that Joe created his own atmosphere, as he
had put it to me, and it was a brand new atmosphere
for the rest of the bunch. He kept dinning it into
them that they were going to win, that Enwright
was a lot of quitters and all tired out, anyway, that
they only needed a touchdown and that they were
on their way to it. And blessed if they didn’t begin
to believe it! And it wasn’t long before Enwright
was thinking there might be something in it, too!
Tru said you could notice the difference five minutes
after the last quarter began. They eased up and
didn’t round off their plays. Their quarter began
to change signals, and once they went back and
put their heads together. When they did that Joe
gloated openly and began to show even more pep.</p>

<p>“Sure!” he cried, “Talk it over! Know you’re
beaten, don’t you? If you’ve got anything left,
show it! Time’s getting short!”</p>

<p>It was, too. There was only about seven minutes
left. We had taken the ball back to their twenty-eight
and had to punt, and they had run it back to
the thirty-six and were shy four yards on the third
down. They got two of the four on a delayed
pass that fooled every one on our team except Joe,
it seemed, and then had to punt. Of course, all they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
wanted now was to kill time, and they tried every
means they knew. But White got away from our
thirty-five with a run that landed the pigskin past
the middle again and then Morgan sent Presson
back into the line-up and Press ate up ten yards in
three plunges. It looked like we had them going
then, and we were cheering ourselves hoarse on the
stand. Joe snarled and bullied, and praised, too,
and in those last five minutes he had every fellow
on the team working for him like dogs. And they
all expected to win, too. That’s the funny part of
it. Dobbs told me afterwards that if we’d been
beaten he would have cried like a kid. But we
weren’t. No, sir, we weren’t. Not that year. We
ate them up from their thirty-eight yards right
down to their ten. They stiffened then and at first
it was like chipping concrete to make gains. There
was hardly more than a minute left. We could hear
Joe barking and yelping. Even when he sounded
the maddest you felt sure that he was going to get
what he was after.</p>

<p>And Enwright knew it, too. Yes, sir, Enwright
showed it right then. She wasn’t cocky any longer.
She was pegged out and nervous and discouraged.
You could see it in the way the backs changed positions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
behind the forwards, not being sure where
they’d better stay, and you could see it in the way
the line started before the ball twice. We made a
yard and a half on the first plunge and lost the half
on the second, and it was nine to go on the third
down.</p>

<p>We were all off the stand by that time, clustering
along the side line and back of the goal, cheering
and yelping at one moment and then being so
still the quarter’s voice sounded like claps of thunder.
Our right end scampered off, Joe passed to
the quarter, quarter faked a forward and dropped
the ball to Maynard and Maynard shot straight into
the center. Joe was clearing the hole out for him,
and he did it to the king’s taste. Right through and
into the secondary defense plunged Joe, taking them
with him as he went, while Maynard, head down,
pigskin clutched to his tummy, followed after.
They stopped them short of the last line, but not
much short, and we still had another down.</p>

<p>The timekeeper was walking nearer and nearer
with his eyes on his watch and we fellows looking
on almost had heart failure. It seemed to us that
our team had never taken longer to line up and
that the quarter had never been so slow with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
signals. But he got them out finally and—Oh, well,
you know what happened. It was Joe again, and
Maynard again, and Enwright went down like nine-pins
and our whole team broke through her center
and went tumbling, streaming over the goal line!
And when the whistle blew Joe had to trot back
from the other side of the end line, he had been
going so hard!</p>

<p>That’s how we broke the hoodoo. Tru failed at
goal, but we had won, thirteen to twelve, anyway.
They elected Joe captain a week later, and he would
have been a corker if the war hadn’t come along.
He went over in the spring, and the next thing we
heard he was top sergeant. I’m sorry for the Huns
in front of Joe’s platoon if he used that psychology
stuff!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BMGD">BILLY MAYES’ GREAT DISCOVERY</h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Captain Ezra Blake, seated on the
edge of the deck-house of the little schooner
<i>Molly and Kate</i>, was trying to do two
things at once. He was superintending the unloading
of ballast by a crew of four men and a boy and
he was answering the questions of Billy Mayes,
who sat beside him. Billy was twelve and Captain
Ezra was almost five times twelve, but they
were great cronies. The <i>Molly and Kate</i> was tied
up to Forster’s Wharf only last evening, and already,
this being a Saturday morning, Billy was
on hand to hear what wonderful adventures had
befallen his friend on the latest voyage. The <i>Molly
and Kate</i> carried lumber to fascinating Southern
ports like Charleston and Savannah and Jacksonville
and even, less frequently, Havana, and never
a voyage but what Captain Ezra returned with a
new budget of marvelous tales for Billy’s delight.
Some day Billy was going to sail with the Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
and see the astounding places and things with his
own two very blue eyes: see Charleston and Cape
Hatteras and the Sea Islands and Florida. But
more especially he would visit Pirate Key, for it
was on Pirate Key that the Captain met with his
very startlingest adventures. Billy had never been
able to find Pirate Key on any map, but, as the
Captain explained, it wasn’t very big and few
mariners even knew of its existence. Somewhere
between the Marquesas and the Dry Tortugas it
lay, and beyond that the Captain declined to commit
himself: which, under the circumstances, Billy
considered quite proper, for it seemed that the
natives of Pirate Key were a peculiarly sensitive
people and much averse to visitors and publicity.
Even the Captain, with his winning personality,
had had much difficulty in becoming friends with
the inhabitants of the island. The first time he
had tried to land on it, many years ago, he and
his crew had been fired on with poisoned arrows.
Captain Ezra could still point out the dents made
by the arrows on the old blue dory that trailed
astern there. The Captain, with one mild gray
eye on the crew, had just finished a soul-stirring
account of the hurricane that had met them off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
the South Carolina coast on their northward trip,
and Billy was still glowing with pride at the thought
of knowing so intimately a person of such nautical
skill and personal bravery, for, although the Captain
hadn’t said so in so many words, it was very
plain that only heroism and remarkable seamanship
had brought the <i>Molly and Kate</i> safely through
great peril, when “Long Joe” Bowen, shoveling
sand nearby, was conquered by a perfectly terrible
spasm of coughing and choking. Captain Ezra
viewed him silently for a moment and then inquired
mildly:</p>

<p>“Been an’ swallered some o’ that sand, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Long Joe” nodded and said “Yes, sir,” in a very
husky voice.</p>

<p>“Mm, well you want to be more careful,” advised
the Captain most sympathetically, “’cause if
you ain’t I’m likely to have to swab out your throat
for you, an’ that’s a remarkably painful operation,
Joe.”</p>

<p>There was no response to this, but Billy could
see “Long Joe’s” shoulders heaving and knew that
he must already be in much pain. Billy, like his
friend the Captain, had a very sympathetic nature.
When the sufferer appeared to be easier Billy looked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
up again at the Captain’s seamed and ruddy
countenance and asked:</p>

<p>“Did you get to Pirate Key this time, sir?”</p>

<p>“Pirate Key?” responded the Captain. “Oh, yes,
we were there a couple o’ days. Not on business,
but you see I’d promised the King I’d drop in on
him the next time I was down around there. Seein’
as he leads a kind o’ lonely life, an’ him an’ me
bein’ particular friends, as you might say, I didn’t
have the heart to say no to him.”</p>

<p>“Was he quite well?” asked Billy politely.</p>

<p>“Pretty smart for an old fellow. You see, Billy,
he’s—let me see—why, he must be well over a
hundred now.”</p>

<p>“A hundred!” gasped the boy.</p>

<p>The Captain nodded gravely. “Them Pirate Key
folks lives a long time. They don’t go to school
until they’re twenty. If they did, you see, they’d
forget all they’d learned afore they was what you
might call middle-aged.”</p>

<p>Billy pondered that. Not going to school until
one was twenty had things to be said in its favor.
Still, it was revolutionary, and he decided to put
it aside for further consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>“And how was the Queen? And the Prince?”
he asked interestedly.</p>

<p>“Well, the Queen was well, but the Prince had
been an’ ate something as didn’t agree with him.
The Royal Physician was some worried when I
got there, but I give him a couple o’ doses of kerosine
oil an’ it did him a power o’ good.”</p>

<p>“The—the physician?” asked Billy doubtfully.</p>

<p>“No, the Prince, o’ course. There wasn’t nothing
the matter with the physician.” The Captain
sounded slightly vexed. “He’d been an’ ate some—some—what’s
this now?—some hoki-moki fruit.”
He viewed Billy sternly. “The Prince had.”</p>

<p>“Really?” asked Billy. “What—what is hoki-moki
fruit like?”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the narrator, knocking the ashes
from his pipe and thoughtfully scraping the bowl
with his pocket knife, “it’s a sort o’ like a orange
an’ sort o’ like a apple.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“An’ it’s pizen if you eat it afore it’s ripe. Don’t
never touch a hoki-moki fruit till it’s purple, Billy.”</p>

<p>Billy promised instantly. “Only,” he added, “I
might not know it, Captain Ezra, if I was to go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
to Pirate Key. Is it round? Does it grow on
trees?”</p>

<p>“More square than round, you might say. It
grows in clusters as big as that water cask there.
Hundreds of ’em together. An’ they grow high
because if they didn’t the wild horses would eat ’em
when they was green an’ die. That’s one o’ the
wonders o’ Nature, Billy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. But I didn’t know horses ate fruit.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t you ever see a horse eat a apple? Why,
they’re plumb fond o’ apples. Bananas, too. An’
watermelons. Guess the only kind o’ fruit a horse
won’t eat is cocoanuts.” The Captain filled his pipe
leisurely and in silence. Then: “Another peculiar
thing, Billy, is that you might call the affinity o’ the
hoki-moki tree an’ them wild horses. They can’t
keep away from ’em, the horses can’t. There’s
something about the—the tree itself that draws the
horses: something in the wood, they say. You don’t
never find any bark on a hoki-moki tree low down
because the wild horses keeps rubbin’ themselves
against it. Seems like they just can’t resist the—the
sub-tile influence. It’s extraordinary.”</p>

<p>Billy agreed emphatically that it was. “Are there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
many wild horses on the key?” he inquired after a
moment.</p>

<p>“Thousands. The natives catch ’em an’ train
’em. The King has more’n three hundred horses
in his private stable, an’ the Queen she has about a
hundred, an’ the Prince he’s got maybe thirty or
forty, too.” The Captain applied a lighted match
to his pipe and puffed blue smoke clouds into the
spring sunlight. “They kill ’em for their hides,
too,” he went on presently. “They make fine
leather.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think they’d need leather,” said Billy,
“being just savages.”</p>

<p>“Savages!” The Captain viewed him reprovingly.
“Don’t you ever let ’em hear you say that,
son! Benighted, in a manner o’ speakin’, they may
be, but they ain’t savages. As for leather, why,
now, they make lots o’ uses o’ it: saddles an’ harnesses
an’ travelin’ bags——”</p>

<p>“Traveling bags!”</p>

<p>“—An’ trunks.” The captain paid no heed to the
interruption. “An’ here’s another peculiar thing.
You may be able to explain it, but I can’t, an’ I
never heard anyone who could. Them hoki-moki
trees has just as much affinity for a horse-hide as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
they has for the horse himself. Lay a horse-hide
saddle twenty feet away from a hoki-moki tree
an’ just as soon as you lets go of it it’ll begin
to move right over to the tree and try to rub itself
against it! Now you explain that!”</p>

<p>“But I can’t,” said Billy, wide-eyed. “It—it’s
most—most extronry!”</p>

<p>“It surely is!” declared the Captain. “What you
might call one o’ the marvels o’ Science. I ain’t
never—That the lot, Joe? Well, I guess it’s most
dinner time, ain’t it? Talkin’ always gives me a
powerful appetite an’ I’m plumb famished. Sing
out to Steve to start that galley fire an’ get a hustle
on him!”</p>

<p>Billy’s thoughts dwelt a good deal for the rest of
that day on Captain Ezra’s interesting discourse,
and when he went to sleep it was to dream terribly
complicated things about wild horses and hoki-moki
trees and the fascinating inhabitants of Pirate Key
who wore the scantiest attires but indulged themselves
in traveling bags! Sunday was always a hard
day to live through, for after church and Sunday
school were past many empty hours stretched ahead.
This Sunday, however, was not so bad, for Mr.
Humbleton, the bank treasurer, came to call in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
afternoon and brought Arthur Humbleton with
him. Arthur was fourteen and a youth of affairs
and position in the community, as became the son
of a bank treasurer. For one thing, Arthur was
captain of the Broadport Junior Baseball Team.
Billy and Arthur were graciously allowed to retire
from the front parlor and the society of their elders
and found sanctuary on the little side porch where
the chill of an easterly April breeze failed to penetrate.
Billy was glad of the opportunity to talk
to Arthur, for he had a request to make, and after
several false starts he managed to make it.</p>

<p>“I wish,” he said, after swallowing hard a couple
of times, “I wish you’d let me play on the nine this
year, Arthur.”</p>

<p>Arthur Humbleton observed him frowningly.
Then he shook his head. “I don’t see how I could,
Billy,” he answered. “The team’s all made up, in
the first place, and then you aren’t much of a player.
Maybe next year——”</p>

<p>“I can play in the outfield all right,” defended
Billy eagerly.</p>

<p>“Oh, most any fellow can catch a fly,” replied
the other carelessly. “There’s more to baseball than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
just that, Billy. You’ve got to know how to run
the bases and bat and lots of things.”</p>

<p>“I can run bases just as fast as——” Billy paused.
He had been going to say “as you can,” but diplomacy
came to his aid. “As fast as Tom Wallace
can,” he substituted.</p>

<p>“Maybe, but you can’t bat a little bit,” responded
Arthur triumphantly. “And you know you can’t.”</p>

<p>“If I had more practice, Arthur——”</p>

<p>“No, sir, you couldn’t ever be a real corking
batter.” Arthur was kindly but firm. “A fellow
has to have the batting eye. Of course I don’t say
that maybe if you worked awfully hard this year
and practiced every day you mightn’t be a lot better,
but I don’t believe you’ll ever be a real star, Billy.”</p>

<p>The subject, engrossing to both boys, continued
for some time, and in the end it was agreed that
Billy should become a sort of unofficial outfield
substitute with the privilege of practicing with the
nine sometimes and making himself useful chasing
the long flies that infrequently went over Mr. Bannerman’s
garden fence. As Mr. Bannerman was
aged and crabbed and disliked seeing small boys
wallowing across his asparagus bed in search of
baseballs, the position assigned to Billy promised as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
much danger as honor. But he knew himself to be
fast on his feet and knew Mr. Bannerman to be
slow, and he accepted gratefully. Soon after that
Arthur was summoned hurriedly by his father, so
hurriedly that he left behind him an enticing blue
paper-bound pamphlet entitled “How to Play Base
Ball” which Billy discovered just before supper and
which he surreptitiously studied later behind the
shielding pages of “Travels in the Holy Land.”</p>

<p>But he found it difficult to understand until he
happened on a dozen pages at the end of the booklet
devoted to advertisements of baseball goods.
There were soul-stirring pictures and descriptions
of mitts and gloves, bats and masks and balls. He
admired and coveted, and mentally compared the
prices set down against the articles with the contents
of the little box in his top bureau drawer
that was his bank. The comparison wasn’t encouraging.
Billy sighed. And just then his eyes fell
on a word that challenged attention. “Westcott’s
Junior League Ball,” he read. “Regulation size and
weight, rubber center, all-wool yarn, double cover
of best quality selected horsehide. Warranted to
last a full game without losing elasticity or shape.”</p>

<p>Billy read it twice. Then he became thoughtful.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
After that he read the description of the baseball
again and his eyes became big and round. Later,
in bed, with the light from the electric lamp at the
corner illuming the ceiling, he lay sleeping for
a long hour, experiencing the triumph that thrills
all great discoverers and inventors.</p>

<p>The next morning he surprised every member of
the household by being downstairs in advance of
breakfast <em>and with his shoes tied</em>! His mother
viewed him anxiously and felt his face but was
unable to detect anything abnormal save, perhaps,
a certain intensity of gaze and impatience of delay.
There was a full half-hour between breakfast and
school and Billy made the most of it. Captain Ezra
was smoking his pipe on the wharf when Billy
arrived, breathless, on the scene.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” exclaimed the Captain. “Ain’t you
round kind of early?”</p>

<p>But there was scant time for amenities and Billy
plunged directly into his business. “Are you going
down South again pretty soon, sir?” he inquired
anxiously. The Captain allowed that he was; as
soon, in fact, as the new cargo was aboard, which,
if he wasn’t saddled with the laziest crew on record,
ought to be in about four days. “And are you going<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
to Pirate Key?” Billy continued. The Captain
blinked.</p>

<p>“Well, I might,” he replied after slight hesitation.
“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because I want you to bring me a piece of that
hoki-moki wood, sir, a piece big enough to make a
bat. You see——”</p>

<p>“A bat? What sort of a bat?”</p>

<p>“Why, a baseball bat. Could you, do you think?
It would have to be that long—” Billy stretched
his arms—“and that big around—” Billy formed
a circle with his small fingers—“and it oughtn’t to
have any knots in it. Is hoki-moki very knotty,
Captain Ezra?”</p>

<p>“Knotty? N-no, I wouldn’t call it that. I——”
He coughed and cast a troubled gaze toward the
lighthouse point. “What was it you wanted it for,
now?”</p>

<p>“A baseball bat,” answered Billy, almost impatiently.
“I thought if you could get me a piece
big enough I could get Jerry Williams, over at
Morris’s carpenter shop, to make it for me. Could
you? Would it—would it be much trouble to you,
sir?”</p>

<p>“Why, n-no, only—hm—you see I ain’t plumb<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
sure of gettin’ to Pirate Key this trip, Billy.” Billy’s
face fell and Captain Ezra went on quickly. “But
I ain’t sayin’ I won’t, you know. Fact is, it’s more’n
likely I will. An’ if I <em>do</em>——”</p>

<p>“Oh, will you please?” cried Billy, beaming.
“How much would it cost, sir? I’ve only got
twenty-two cents, but if you’d take that I’d pay you
the rest when you came back.” He dug into a
pocket, but the Captain waved the suggestion aside.</p>

<p>“Shucks,” he said, “a little piece o’ wood ain’t
goin’ to cost nothin’. Why, I guess I could bring
off a whole tree if I wanted it. I guess there ain’t
anything on that there island I couldn’t have for
the askin’, Billy, the King an’ me bein’ so friendly.
Tell you what I’ll do now. I’ll get ’em to cut a
piece o’ that wood an’ make the bat for you right
there. How’ll that be?”</p>

<p>Billy looked dubious. “Why, that’s awfully
kind, sir, but—but do you think they’d know how
to make a baseball bat? Bats have to be made
awf’ly partic’larly, Captain Ezra, or else they aren’t
much good.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about that, son. They been
makin’ their own bats on Pirate Key for years, an’
I guess there ain’t no better ones to be had.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p>“Why, do they play baseball <em>there</em>?” gasped the
boy.</p>

<p>“’Course they do! Leastways, they play what’s
pretty near like it. The—the general idea’s similar.
They’re plumb crazy about it, too. They got a
eight-club league down there——”</p>

<p>But at that moment the bell in the town hall
clanged its first stroke and Billy fled.</p>

<p>During the four days that the <i>Molly and Kate</i>
remained at Forster’s Wharf, Billy and the Captain
met twice and when the schooner finally sailed the
Captain had full, detailed and most explicit instructions
regarding that length of straight, well-seasoned
hoki-moki wood that was to be brought back
either in the rough or shaped into the Pirate Key
idea of a baseball bat. After that there was nothing
for Bill to do save await the return of the schooner.</p>

<p>April gave place to May and the Broadport
Juniors began to play Saturday afternoon games
on the back common and to practice diligently
on other days after school was over. Billy served
a rigorous apprenticeship in the outfield, chasing
flies that went over the heads of the regular players
and several times scrambling over Mr. Bannerman’s
fence and recovering the ball from under the rhubarb<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
or from between the rows of early peas. So
far fortune had attended him and he had invariably
escaped with his life. Now and then he was allowed
to take his turn with the batters and stand
up at the plate while Waldo Hutchins pitched his
famous “slow ones.” Practice is supposed to make
perfect, but Billy was still a long way from perfection
as a batsman. Nor could either he or Arthur
Humbleton observe any great amount of improvement.
But Billy persisted, consoling himself with
rosy dreams of the future. Almost any day now
the <i>Molly and Kate</i> might return bearing Billy’s
Great Discovery.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Juniors won from Scalfield Grammar
School, were defeated by the West Side Reds
and were annihilated by the Downerport Eagles.
And then, as it seemed to Billy, just in the nick of
time to prevent a similar fate at the hands of that
especial rival, the Broadport White Sox, the <i>Molly
and Kate</i> tied up again at Forster’s Wharf!</p>

<p>That was an eventful day in Billy’s life, eventful
from the moment he heard the glad news to the
moment that he was back at the house with the
precious hoki-moki bat in his possession. He had
scarcely heard Captain Ezra’s detailed and interesting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
account of the securing of the article. For once,
anxious to put the bat to the test, Billy thought the
Captain just the least bit loquacious! But he banished
the thought almost instantly, blushing for its
ungraciousness, and quite overwhelmed his benefactor
with thanks ere he hurried away with the
bat tightly clutched in hand and one jacket pocket
bulging with a perfectly good “genuine horsehide”
ball that had seen only two weeks’ service in practice
and had been acquired from Captain Humbleton
for fifteen cents.</p>

<p>Subsiding, much out of breath, on the edge of
the side porch, Billy once more examined his prize
with eager eyes. As to shape it looked as fine as
the best “wagon tongue” ever made. There was no
doubt about it, those Pirate Key natives knew how
to make a baseball bat! Billy was just a trifle disappointed
about one thing, however, and that was
the lack of novelty. To all appearance the bat was
quite like any other bat except that the inscription
“Genuine Hoki-Moki Wood” appeared half-way
along its smooth length. The words were printed
in uneven characters, and evidently with pen and
ink, and the ink had run with the grain of the wood.
The varnish was still new and just a bit sticky, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
that was to be expected since varnish always dried
slowly near salt water. Hoki-moki wood was, contrary
to Billy’s preconceived idea, light instead of
dark, and closely resembled ash. A surprising
feature of the bat was the twine-wound handle. It
seemed strange to Billy that the natives of Pirate
Key should know of that refinement. His respect
for them grew tremendously then and there.</p>

<p>Having examined the bat to his heart’s content,
he stood up and swung it experimentally. It proved
the least bit heavier than he could have wished, but
that wasn’t anything to trouble about. He had
frequently heard Jack Cantrell express a preference
for a heavy bat, and Jack was the hard-hitter of
the Broadport Juniors. Remained now the supreme
test, and Billy approached it falteringly. Suppose
it failed! Suppose Captain Ezra’s tales of the peculiar
properties of hoki-moki wood proved false!
Billy felt that the disappointment would be more
than he could bear! Nerving himself to the ordeal,
he laid the bat at the edge of the porch, squeezed
the horsehide ball from his pocket and deposited it
with trembling fingers against the house. Seven
feet separated ball and bat, and as he withdrew his
fingers he gave a deep troubled sigh. For an instant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
it seemed that the experiment was to fail, and Billy’s
heart sank sickeningly. But then, as he stepped
back across the boards to the porch’s edge the
miracle happened. Slowly, irresolutely the ball
moved, rolled a few inches, stopped, went on,
gathered momentum and traveled straight along a
board until it bumped companionably against the
hoki-moki bat!</p>

<p>Billy shrieked his triumph and danced ecstatically
on the mignonette bed. It was true! The Great
Discovery was proved.</p>

<p>Again he tried the experiment and again the ball
yielded to the magic influence of the bat as the
needle of a compass yields to the influence of the
North Pole. Thrice the experiment worked perfectly.
A fourth time the ball, having been placed
further to the left, collided with the handle of the
bat, jumped it and rolled over the edge of the porch
into the flower bed. Billy waited for it to rise up
and come back again, but that effort appeared beyond
it. Considering that a distance of eighteen
inches intervened between porch floor and flower
bed, Billy felt that it would be asking too much
of the ball. Anyway, it atoned a minute later by
rolling nicely from house wall to bat with what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
seemed greater alacrity. Billy was more than
satisfied.</p>

<p>I feel that I ought to inform the reader of a fact
that quite escaped Billy, which is that the outer
edge of the side porch was fully an inch and a half
lower than the inner, being so built that water
would run off it. I doubt if Billy ever knew of this.
Certainly the slope was not perceptible to an unsuspicious
vision. I make no claim that the slope
of the porch floor had anything to do with the remarkable
behavior of the ball. I am willing to
believe that the ball would have rolled across to the
bat had the floor been perfectly level. I only mention
the fact in the interest of truth.</p>

<p>Later Billy sought the back yard and tried throwing
the ball in the air and hitting it with the bat.
At first this experiment proved less successful than
the other, but presently he found, to his great delight,
that he could hit almost every time! To be
sure, he didn’t always hit just squarely, but he hit.
That absorbing occupation came to an end when
the ball went through a cellar window with a fine
sound of breaking glass. Thereupon Billy recovered
the ball and went innocently in to supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>That night, for fear of burglary, Billy slept with
the hoki-moki bat beside him under the covers.</p>

<p>The next day was Saturday and the day of the
White Sox game. Billy spent most of the morning
knocking the ball against the back yard fence and
only desisted when Aunt Julia informed him from
an upstairs window that she had a headache and
would go crazy if he didn’t stop making all that
noise. Billy stopped and went and sat on the side
porch, with his feet in the mignonette and the
hoki-moki bat hugged to his triumphant breast, and
dreamed dreams worthy of Cæsar or Napoleon.</p>

<p>The Broadport Juniors wanted to win to-day’s
game, wanted to win it more than they wanted to
win any other contest in a long and comprehensive
schedule. The White Sox team was comprised of
boys who lived on the Hill. The Hill was the town’s
patrician quarter. Just about everyone who lived
up there had an automobile and a chauffeur to drive
it and wore their good clothes all the time. The
juvenile residents of that favored locality were, in
the estimate of the down-town boys, stuck-up and
snobbish, and they had a fine opinion of their baseball
prowess. The worst of it was that their opinion
was justified, for the White Sox—the down-towners<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
jeeringly called them the Silk Sox—usually beat
almost every team they went up against! Last year
the Juniors had played two contests with them and
had been beaten decisively each time. And so Captain
Arthur Humbleton and all the other boys of
the Juniors and all their adherents—including
mothers and brothers and sisters and an occasional
father—were especially keen on a victory. And
when, in the first of the sixth inning, the White Sox
finally solved Waldo’s delivery and made three hits
and, aided by an infield error, sent four runs over
the plate the Juniors’ bright dream faded and despondency
gloomed the countenance of Captain
Humbleton and his doughty warriors. The White
Sox had already held a one-run lead, the score at
the start of the sixth having been 12 to 11, and
now, with four more tallies added, they looked to
have the contest safely on ice.</p>

<p>Billy, his precious bat held firmly between his
knees, occupied a seat on the substitute’s bench, a
yellow-grained settee borrowed from the High
School across the common. He had twice offered
his services to Arthur and they had been twice
refused, the second time with a scowl. Billy was
absolutely certain that he could, if allowed to face<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
the opposing batter, who hadn’t much but a fast
ball to boast of, deliver wallops that would radically
alter the history of the game. But the hoki-moki
bat was no better than any little old sixty-cent
stick so long as he was not allowed to use it.
To his credit is the fact that he had determined,
in case the White Sox still held the lead at the
beginning of the ninth inning, to entrust the bat
to others should Arthur still refuse his services.
That was real self-denial, real patriotism. As much
as Billy wanted to wield the wonderful hoki-moki
bat himself victory for the team stood first.</p>

<p>The friends of the Juniors clapped and cheered
as “Wink” Billings went to bat in the last of the
sixth, and the one who cheered the loudest was
Captain Ezra Blake. The Captain had come at
Billy’s earnest and repeated behest and had togged
himself out wonderfully in honor of the occasion.
The Captain did not, Billy suspected now, know a
great deal about baseball, for he cheered just as
loudly when a villainous White Sox rapped out a
two-bagger as he did when one of the Juniors
stole home from third. But it was very evident
that the Captain’s intentions were of the best.</p>

<p>The last of the sixth developed no runs for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
Juniors, nor did the seventh add to the score of
either side. In the eighth the White Sox captain
got to third with two down and tried to tally on
a bunt past the pitcher’s box. But shortstop ran in,
scooped up the ball and nailed him a foot from the
plate. The Juniors started their inning by a safe
rap that placed Cantrell on first base. Myers sacrificed
neatly and then the next man connected for
a screeching liner that was too hot for the Sox
second baseman and Cantrell scored the Juniors’
twelfth tally. But the score was still four runs to
the advantage of the White Sox when Stone hit into
a double and ended the inning.</p>

<p>Captain Humbleton pretended a confidence he
didn’t feel and assured the team that all they had
to do now was hold the Sox and then bat out a
victory. It sounded easy, but Billy felt defeat impending.
He tried to get a word with Arthur
before that youth hurried off to his infield position,
but failed. The White Sox started by putting their
third baseman on first in consequence of Waldo
Hutchins’ inability to pitch strikes. Then a bunt
was mishandled by the catcher and there were runners
on first and second, and things looked very
bad. The next player was thrown out, but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
others moved up a base apiece. The infield crept
closer. The White Sox left fielder tried hard to
slug, missed two and finally popped up a silly little
foul that dropped comfortably in the catcher’s mitt,
and the Junior nine’s adherents cheered loudly,
Captain Ezra’s voice dominating all like a fog siren.
There was another period of doubt and anxiety
when, after knocking the ball everywhere save between
the foul lines, the Sox first baseman finally
whaled out a long, arching fly. The bases emptied
and the runners scuttled home, but Leo Smith arose
to the occasion like a veteran—which he was not—and
pulled down the ball.</p>

<p>“Four to tie ’em and five to win!” shouted
Arthur as he trotted in to the bench. “Come on
now, fellows! Let’s get this! We can—— What
is it, Billy? Don’t bother me now!”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to, Arthur,” said Billy firmly, a tight
clutch on the captain’s arm. “You’ve got to listen
a minute. If you want to win this you must let
me bat, Arthur. I can’t help hitting with this bat,
honest, and——”</p>

<p>“You’re up, Waldo! Work him for a base. Get
it somehow!” Arthur tugged impatiently, but Billy
held like glue. “You see, it’s a hoki-moki wood bat,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
Arthur, and hoki-moki wood has a—a infinity for
horsehide. All you got to do is just swing the bat
and the ball comes right up and hits it. It’s the
greatest discovery of——”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” demanded the
captain. “Let’s see your old bat. ‘Hoki-Moki
Wood,’ eh?” he jeered. “Where’d you get this contraption?”</p>

<p>And, still holding him firmly, Billy told him,
and in spite of his expression of incredulity Arthur
was secretly a little bit impressed. “Oh, shucks,”
he said, “I don’t believe it, Billy! It ain’t possible!
’Course, you might have luck——” He
paused and frowned intently and then, with a short
laugh, added: “Maybe I’ll give you a chance, Billy.
We’ll see.”</p>

<p>Billy had to be content with that. Meanwhile
Waldo Hutchins had waited and walked. An attempted
sacrifice, however, failed to work and
Waldo was cut off at second. The runner was safe
on first. With one gone the audience began to
disperse slowly. Then the Juniors’ right fielder
landed squarely and rapped past third and hope
crept back into the breasts of his team-mates. The
departing onlookers paused in their flight. The Sox<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
second baseman let the throw from the pitcher pass
unchallenged over his head and the runners advanced
to second and third. The cheering grew
frantic. The coachers shouted and danced. “Slim”
Gaynor did his best but only laid the ball down in
front of the plate and was tagged out before he
had taken two strides toward his base. Two on,
now, and two gone!</p>

<p>Billy, his heart racing and jumping, watched
Arthur anxiously. But Joe Ware was allowed to
take his turn. Joe was an uncertain batter. The
White Sox pitcher tempted him with a low one
and with one on the outside, but Joe refused them.
Then came a fast one that went as a strike. Then
one that hit the dirt just back of the plate. The
pitcher frowned and would have sent the next
offering in the groove had not the catcher signalled
for a pass. Joe walked to first, filling the sacks,
and cheers filled the air. Arthur himself followed
Joe Ware, and the bunt he trickled along the first
base line was a veritable marvel, for it sent a tally
across, moved runners from first and second and
left Arthur himself safe on his bag!</p>

<p>But three runs were still needed to tie and four
to win, and there were two gone. Billy arose, pale<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
but resolved on sacrifice. He meant to offer the
precious hoki-moki bat to Steve Sawyer, next up,
but as he moved toward the plate Arthur, dusting
himself on first, saw him and recalled that half
promise. And perhaps he had what he would have
called a “hunch.” At all events his voice reached
Billy just as he was about to present the bat to
Steve’s notice:</p>

<p>“All right, Billy! Hit it out! Let Billy bat,
Steve!”</p>

<p>And so Billy, with a fast-beating heart, went on
to the plate and faced his fate. Surprise and condemnation
floated from the bench in mutters. The
Sox pitcher observed Billy’s small form with a puzzled
frown. Then, noting the boy’s evident nervousness,
he laughed in derision “See who’s here,
Jim!” he called to his catcher. “Home-Run Baker,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“No, it’s Tris Speaker! Be good to him, Tom!”</p>

<p>“All right! Try this one, kid!” The pitcher
wound up. Billy pushed his bat around over his
shoulder. On bases the three runners danced and
shouted. The coachers yelled incessantly. The infield
jabbered. But Billy didn’t hear a sound. Now
the pitcher’s arm was shooting forward. The ball<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
was singing its way toward him. He tried to watch
it and couldn’t. But he swung the hoki-moki bat
around just as hard as he knew how, putting every
ounce of his strength into it, and something happened.
There was a resounding blow, electric tingles
shot up Billy’s arms, he staggered and then,
first.</p>

<p>Far into right field sped the ball, just inside the
base line. In raced the runners. Billy raced too.
Pandemonium assailed his ears. As he reached the
first bag he sent a final look after the ball and his
heart leaped with joy. Straight behind Mr. Bannerman’s
garden fence it fell, right amongst the
early peas and bush limas!</p>

<p>“Take your time, Billy!” shouted the coach at
first. “It’s a home run, kid!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They never did find that ball, for Mr. Bannerman
appeared on the scene most inopportunely, but
it didn’t matter and no one cared. The Juniors
had won, 17 to 16! The hoki-moki bat had proved
itself! And Billy Mayes was a hero!</p>

<p>There were unbelievers who denied to Billy’s
famous bat any special virtue, but Billy knew what
he knew and had seen what he had seen, and his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
faith was unshakable. But, and here is the sorry
part of my tale, it was several years before Billy
made another home run, for, although he became a
regular member of the team and, as time passed,
became a fairly dependable hitter, the hoki-moki
bat had lost its cunning. It was not the bat’s fault,
however. It was due to the fact that, owing to
the war, baseballs were no longed covered with
horsehide!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="TTM">THE TWO-MILER</h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">We were sure of winning that spring. John
Blake, the manager of the team, said that
if we did not win he should walk home
when school closed. And as John lives in the western
part of Ohio and is a man of his word, you can
see that we were pretty cocksure.</p>

<p>We met Maynard College and Chamberlain College
every June in what we at Preston called the
“Tri-Track,” which was a quick way of saying Triangular
Track Meet. The year before, Maynard
had beaten us by five and a half points. Chamberlain
usually did not produce a strong team, although
it had a way now and then of upsetting our calculations
in an irritating manner.</p>

<p>We had been hard at work all the spring, and
when the Saturday of the “Tri-Track” came we
had seventeen men ready to do their best. The
meet that year was at Chamberlain, and in consequence
we put Chamberlain down for twenty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
points, five more than she had ever won. There
were one hundred and seventeen points in the thirteen
events; to win first place in any event counted
five, second place three and third place one.</p>

<p>As I say, we allowed Chamberlain twenty points,
mostly seconds and thirds, although we did think
that her man Cutler would capture first in the high
jump. Then we put ourselves down for seven firsts.
That made thirty-five points. We felt likewise sure
of five seconds. That gave us fifteen points more,
making fifty in all—more than enough to win. We
conceded the rest to Maynard.</p>

<p>Of those seven events in which we expected firsts,
only one seemed in the least doubtful; that was the
two-mile race.</p>

<p>Carl Atherton, the captain of the team, had run
the distance the year before in 10 minutes, 41⅘
seconds, and had cut that down a second this spring
in practice. But all the year we had been hearing
a good deal about a new runner at Maynard named
Beckner, who was said to have done the two miles
in forty “flat.” We felt willing, however, to trust
Carl for the two miles.</p>

<p>John Blake decided that for once the whole team
should go to Chamberlain. Usually our funds were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
low, and only the men who were absolutely necessary
were taken; but this year the subscriptions had
been more liberal.</p>

<p>Bobby Hart was almost as much pleased as anyone
at John’s decision. Bobby had worked hard
during the two years he had been in school, and
deserved to get into a real race. He was not a
great runner, but there is plenty of room on the
track in the “distance” runs.</p>

<p>“I’m going to try for third in the mile,” Bobby
confided to me on Friday night. “I think I can do
better than I ever have done.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I’m afraid you can’t get third. First
will go either to Carl or to Dick Bannet, and Maynard’s
sure to have a man close to them. I shouldn’t
wonder if Carl let Bannet have the mile and saved
himself for the two.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, I’ll have the fun of trying,” answered
Bobby.</p>

<p>We went over to Chamberlain Saturday morning,
and nearly the whole school went with us.</p>

<p>Bobby was in great spirits. He kept us laughing
all the way over, and I could not help thinking what
a difference there was between him and Carl Atherton.
There was Bobby, as happy as a clam because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
they had entered him for the mile and the two mile
with no chance in the world of his winning better
than third, and small hope of that; and there was
Carl, happy, too, perhaps, but not showing it a bit,
just sitting down at the end of the car talking to
the trainer or reading a magazine, yet knowing all
the time that he was sure of one cup, if not two.
I could not help thinking that of the two perhaps
Bobby would have made the better captain, if getting
close to the fellows and heartening them up
had anything to do with it.</p>

<p>We had luncheon at twelve o’clock, and at half-past
one we piled into a coach and drove out to the
field. The old village was much decorated, and the
crimson of Preston was more plentiful than the
Maynard blue. Of course the orange and gray of
Chamberlain was everywhere.</p>

<p>We went into our dressing tent, put on our running
clothes, and then went out and limbered up
a bit.</p>

<p>At two o’clock the half mile was started, and we
were pretty well pleased with ourselves when it was
over. Maynard got third place, but the one point
for Maynard did not look important against eight
that we won.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>Then came the trials for the hundred yards; two
of our men qualified. We did not expect much from
the sprints, and we did not get much. In the finals
we took third place; Maynard won first and Chamberlain
second. That started the cheering, for the
orange and gray was pretty well represented on the
stands, where Maynard and Preston had each only
a handful of fellows. When they called us for the
trials of the high hurdles, I did not have any trouble
in winning from the two Chamberlain runners and
the one Maynard man opposed to me. Then came
the mile run.</p>

<p>Each school was allowed three starters; our
entries were Carl Atherton, Dick Bannet and Bobby
Hart. I heard the trainer giving them their instructions.</p>

<p>“This is Bannet’s race if he can get it,” he said.
“But if Bannet can’t win it, you must, Atherton.
Hart, here, will start in and make the pace for you
two, and at the end of the third lap you must draw
up to the front. Save yourself for the two miles
if you can, Atherton; but if you have to win this,
do it. We can’t take any chances. And you see if
you can’t take third place, Hart.”</p>

<p>The nine runners did some pretty maneuvering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
for the pole. When they went down the back stretch
on the first lap, Bobby was making pace and Carl
and Bannet were running fourth and fifth. That
was the order for two laps. Then a Maynard chap
named Green sprinted and took the lead. Bannet
pushed up to third place.</p>

<p>Bobby held on for a while, then dropped back.
He had just about used himself up. Beckner, the
Maynard “crack,” was running strongly in sixth
place, and Carl was watching him closely at every
turn.</p>

<p>When the last lap began only five men were left
in the running—Green, Bannet, Fuller of Chamberlain,
Carl and Beckner.</p>

<p>That was a pretty race; but it did not come out
right for us. When the home stretch began, Fuller
passed Bannet and Beckner got away from Carl.
Then it was Fuller, Bannet and Beckner all the way
to within twenty feet of the tape, with a couple of
thousand spectators yelling like mad, and crimson
and blue and orange flags waving.</p>

<p>Carl was trying hard to come forward, but he
had waited too long and was out of it; just as
much out of it as Bobby, who was jogging doggedly
along half a lap behind. Twenty feet from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
finish Fuller spurted again and left two yards between
him and the two others, who were fighting
hard for second place.</p>

<p>“Come on, Dick!” we shrieked. “Come on!
Come on!”</p>

<p>But Bannet could not do any more, and Beckner
drew slowly away from him in the last half dozen
strides. Bannet was used up when we caught him.
And Fuller, too, was pretty tired. Only Beckner
seemed fresh, and we knew then that he could have
had first place if he had wanted it, and that he was
saving himself for the two miles.</p>

<p>Things did not look so bright for us after that
race. And after the next one, the finals in the one-hundred-and-twenty-yard
hurdles, they looked
worse; for all I could do was to get second by a
hair’s breadth; Maynard took first by several yards
and Chamberlain third.</p>

<p>I was pretty well cut up over that, but there
was still the two-hundred-and-twenty, and I vowed
that I would do better in that. There was need of
improvement, for we had thirteen points to Maynard’s
fourteen, with Chamberlain not far behind
with nine. Things were not happening at all as we
had figured them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>We had counted on eight points in the quarter-mile
race, but all we got was three, for almost at
the start Carstein of Chamberlain left everyone behind
and won by fully thirty yards! That was the
trouble with Chamberlain; you never could tell what
mischief it would cause.</p>

<p>They called us out for the two-hundred-and-twenty-yard
hurdle race. The Maynard man and I
were nip and tuck at the second hurdle. I was a
little quicker on the cinders than he, but he hurdled
a good three inches lower than I, and that made
things even. But at the fourth hurdle he got down
too low and went over the bar. That put him out
of pace a little, and I ran for all I was worth. I
tipped the next hurdle myself, but not enough to
throw me out.</p>

<p>At the seventh, I think it was, I was running
even with the chap at the far side of the track and
the Maynard fellow was behind. After that I put
every ounce into beating the unknown—for there
was no time to see who he was—and we had a battle
royal. We came over the last hurdle right together,
and only my speed on the ground beat him, and
then by very little. Maynard finished a close third.
And when I turned round and looked at the chap<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
I’d beaten, I found it was one of our own men.
Bert Poole, who had never won a place before in
his life!</p>

<p>We felt better after that, for those eight points
put us ahead; but when presently Maynard won six
points in the furlong dash and Chamberlain got the
remaining three, we began to worry again. The
results from the field events then began to come in,
and added to our anxiety. Chamberlain had taken
first in the high jump, as we expected, but Maynard
had left us only third place. In the broad jump
Maynard had won first place and third, and given
us second. In the pole vault that troublesome
Chamberlain had again taken first; Maynard had
taken second and Preston third. In the shot put
we had first and second, and Maynard had taken
third. In the hammer throw Maynard had beaten
us for first, we had taken second and Chamberlain
third. When we had finished figuring we could
hardly believe our eyes. The score stood:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noi">Preston 40<br />
Maynard 40<br />
Chamberlain 28</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>The two-mile run, the last event, would decide the
meet. And there was Beckner.</p>

<p>Of course we had not lost faith in Carl, but big,
strong Beckner was clearly the freshest man on the
field, and he would take a lot of beating. We had
to have first place to win the meet. Second and
third would not be enough, unless Fuller of Chamberlain
got first. In that case the championship
would go to the school that took second. We did
not know whether Fuller was going to run or not,
and we were pretty anxious to find out. Only
Bobby seemed cheerful.</p>

<p>“We can beat them,” he said. “Why, Carl can
make circles round Beckner, and as for Fuller, that
mile run used him all up.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you will do something yourself, Bobby,”
said I.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t mind trying, but I guess they’re not
going to let me enter. I didn’t show up very well
in the mile; you can’t go in and set the pace and
have anything left for the end. I came in fifth,
though.” Bobby really looked pleased with himself.</p>

<p>“All out for the two-mile run!” called the clerk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
of the course, and we went down to the start. John
Blake was looking blue.</p>

<p>“It’s a long way out to Ohio,” he said ruefully.
“And the roads are dusty, too.”</p>

<p>“Fuller’s going to run, isn’t he?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I don’t know whether that makes it
better for us or worse.”</p>

<p>“Answer to your names!” called the clerk.</p>

<p>There were seven entries there: Carl and Bannet
of our school, Beckner, Green and another Maynard
runner, and Fuller and one other Chamberlain
fellow.</p>

<p>“On your marks!” called the starter.</p>

<p>“Hold on, please,” said our coach. “We have
another man coming. Where’s Hart?”</p>

<p>“Here,” said Bobby, stepping out from the group
beside the track.</p>

<p>“Get in there,” said the trainer.</p>

<p>So Bobby, much pleased, took his place in the
second line.</p>

<p>“Get ready!” said the starter.</p>

<p>“Set!” <a href="#i_fp094">Then the pistol popped and they were
off.</a></p>

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_236">THEN THE PISTOL POPPED AND THEY WERE OFF</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>For the first mile and a half a two-mile race is
generally rather uninteresting; but when the meet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
depends on it, that is different. We turned and
watched the runners jog round the turn and come
along the back stretch.</p>

<p>When they had covered a quarter of the distance,
Fuller was no longer dangerous. He was running
in short strides and had dropped back to seventh
place. At the end of the first mile the runners
were strung out all round the track. Green was
making the pace. Behind Green was Beckner, running
with a fine long stride, and almost treading
on Beckner’s heels was Carl. Carl was not quite
so pretty a runner to watch as the man in front
of him.</p>

<p>Ten or twelve yards behind Carl ran Bannet;
Bobby was following close. A third Maynard runner
and Fuller were disputing sixth place. A long
way behind them the last man, a Chamberlain chap,
was lagging along. And that was still the order
when the sixth lap began.</p>

<p>Beckner alone seemed untired. Carl’s cheeks were
white, and had two spots of crimson in them. Bannet
was looking pretty well used up, but Bobby seemed
not yet fagged and hung on to Bannet closely. He
had never tried himself to any extent in the two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
miles, but I thought that he was doing better than
he had done in the mile.</p>

<p>Getting tired of making pace Green swung aside
and let Beckner take the lead. Green fell in behind
Carl, who was still treading in Beckner’s tracks.
Then the distance between the first group and the
second began to open; Bannet was tiring. For a
while Bobby regulated his speed by Bannet’s, but
soon he went round outside Bannet and passed him.
That seemed to do Bannet good, for he spurted and
kept close behind Bobby all round the track. The
third Maynard man and Fuller were out of it for
good by this time, and the eighth man had left the
track.</p>

<p>There were only two laps left now, and the shouting
was pretty continuous. Up at the head Beckner
seemed to want Carl to take the lead, but Carl refused.
That cheered us considerably, for it seemed
to show that Beckner was weakening. Finally
Green went to Beckner’s rescue; but he almost
pumped himself out in doing it, and only set the
pace for a few hundred feet, making it so slow that
Bobby and Bannet closed up half the distance between
them and Carl. Then Green fell out again<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
and Beckner was once more ahead, but Carl was
holding on grimly.</p>

<p>So it was when they turned into the home stretch.
The shouting was tremendous now, for the spectators
had left the stands and lined up along the
track.</p>

<p>“Last lap! Last lap!” shouted the judges.</p>

<p>We shouted to Carl to keep it up! And the
Chamberlain people, who liked us better than they
liked Maynard, shouted the same thing. Even
Bobby and Bannet were applauded, and I shouted to
Bobby to go on and win.</p>

<p>On the turn Bannet stumbled and half fell, and
lost several yards; that seemed to take the heart
out of him. When the runners turned into the back
stretch, Bobby was all alone a dozen yards behind
Beckner, Carl and Green.</p>

<p>About the middle of the stretch Beckner started
to draw away from Carl; but he only opened up
about three yards before Carl was after him. That
put Green out of it. We saw him wabble once and
then throw up his arms and go over on the turf.</p>

<p>“Bobby’s going to get third place!” cried John.
And, sure enough, there was Bobby still running,
and running strong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>But our eyes were on Carl and Beckner. They
were having it out, and as the turn began Carl crept
up to the blue runner and tried to edge past; but he
couldn’t quite do it, and Beckner held the lead by
a few feet until they were in the straightaway and
headed for the finish. Then Carl actually got in
front. A lot of us had gone halfway down the
track to meet them and were yelling ourselves
hoarse.</p>

<p>“Come on, Carl! Come on! You can do it!”</p>

<p>The Maynard fellows were shouting to Beckner
at the top of their lungs. Carl was just about holding
his lead, when suddenly he staggered, got one
foot on the raised board that runs along the inside
of the track, and fell on the cinders. He was up
in a second and running again, but he had lost
three or four yards, was limping and was plainly
exhausted. And Beckner, none too fresh himself,
came on down the home stretch all alone, wabbling
a bit, but apparently an easy winner.</p>

<p>“Look at <em>Bobby</em>!” cried John. “Oh, <em>look</em> at
Bobby!”</p>

<p>How he ever got there I don’t know, but there
was that blessed Bobby coming along only a few
yards behind Beckner and gaining on him at every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
stride. Now he had passed Carl; now he was almost
up to the Maynard man; and we were racing alongside,
leaping and shouting, while twenty yards ahead
at the finish the judges were leaning forward with
excited faces and their fingers on the “stops.”</p>

<p>Stride by stride Bobby overhauled Beckner. Now
he could have touched him with his hand. Now he
was running even. Now—</p>

<p>“<em>Preston!</em>” we cried. “<em>Preston! Preston!</em>”</p>

<p>And then there was the finish—Bobby flying
down the turn and Beckner falling into the arms of
his fellows.</p>

<p>“Who won?” I shouted, dancing about in the
crowd.</p>

<p>“Hart, by two feet!” said some one.</p>

<p>And John and I grabbed each other and danced.</p>

<p>“Hurray!” shouted John. “I don’t have to walk
home!”</p>

<p>“Did you hear the time?” cried Poole, hitting me
on the back. “Ten minutes, thirty-six and four-fifths
seconds! It breaks the record!”</p>

<p>We did an unusual thing that Spring. We elected
a track-team captain who was not a senior. His
name was Robert Hart.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
